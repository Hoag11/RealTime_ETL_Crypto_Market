        "BODY": "Summary I rate Circle (CRCL) a BUY, driven by resilient reserve yields and accelerating USDC network monetization, especially via the FIS banking partnership. Circle’s fundamentals are strong: Q2 revenue grew 53% YoY, USDC circulation is expanding, and network-driven income is gaining traction beyond reserve yields. Key risks include regulatory divergence, interest rate cuts compressing reserve income, and execution risks in banking integration and competition from Tether. I see asymmetric upside after the correction to $130/share; catalysts include index inclusion, enterprise adoption, and improved transparency. Reserves Today, Monetization Tomorrow Circle's(NYSE: CRCL ) price is currently driven mainly by the Fed's rate decision and adoption. There are opinions that the Fed will cut rates and companies will see a significant drop in reserve yields. However, inflation in the US is holding up more than expected, and the Fed will not cut rates so quickly that it will devalue reserve yields. Then we have the second significant change, and that is OTC:USDC , which is growing in circulation at an ever-increasing rate, and is also heading from the crypto world to banks thanks to the FIS partnership. After a relatively fresh and dynamic return to the price of $130 per share, we are at a point where it makes sense for me to re-enter this company. At least one of the above variables will work and bring rewards to investors. Either higher rates will remain, or transaction monetization will take off to a greater extent. I see a combination of both as a realistic scenario, which is why I chose a BUY rating, which narrowly missed STRONG BUY, the reasons for which will be explained below. Chart of CRCL (TradingView) From Euphoria To Doubt I was interested in how quickly the cards can turn. At Circle, we could see one bolder headline than the other before earnings. Everything was bathed in sunshine and everyone saw a bright light. After earnings, the cards turned and I can't help but be surprised at how much attention is currently being paid to the quality of sales. In essence, all negative sentiment turns to the quality of the company's sales, which it translates as a carry trade on rates, and that functional transaction channels for banks are still in sight. I would like to disagree here, because on the one hand I think that rates will stay with us longer (inflation, fiscal policy, AI CAPex), and on the other hand Circle is gradually moving from carry trade to monetizing its network. I perceive the more dynamic depreciation of the share price to $130 more as a cleansing of overly optimistic sentiment than as a warning signal. Circle is a relatively new name on the exchange, but it is among the veterans in the crypto world. It is a fintech that issues USDC, which is 100% backed by cash and other highly liquid substitutes with immediate 1:1 convertibility. Circle is trying to gradually turn USDC into transaction paths that technically rely on CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol), which is supposed to increase capital efficiency. In addition, thanks to the partnership with FIS , USDC will appear in MMH (Money Movement Hub) alongside RTP, FedNow and ACH as another real-time corridor for banking houses. The shares have experienced a sharp rise after the IPO, and are currently in a healthy correction. Even if the market wanted to question the quality of the returns, Circle is not a pure carry trade on rates. In my opinion, reserve yields will not disappear overnight (the Fed has no reason to rush due to inflation data ), and in the meantime, the part of our business that is independent of the level of rates (network, volumes, and bank distribution) is growing. Circle's principles (Circle.com) What Do We Know So Far I would start with the numbers, because when we clear the noise, the facts remain. Q2 brought in total revenue of $658 million (+53% YoY). At the same time, USDC in circulation increased to $61.3 billion and annual transaction volume swelled to $6 billion. The data provides us with information that the network expansion is going well. On the other hand, yes, the accounting results were affected by non-cash items after the IPO , however, this does not change the fact that the “engine” in the form of the network is running and functioning. Then there is a new share subscription. If this were an emergency brake, the company would have fallen significantly below $130 per share after this information. The reality is that out of 10 million shares, 2 million went to the primary subscription, and 8 million to the secondary with a price anchor of $130 per share. This can serve as a new measure of liquidity and a reference range through which we can continue to grow after the sentiment calms down and the fundamentals do not disappear. And as for the banks? This is where the debate most often goes. The partnership with FIS is not a blogpost for the crypto community, but it is a detailed integration of USDC into MMH. The construction of infrastructure such as RTP, ACH, etc. will not be reflected in sales overnight, but in 6-12 months in volumes that are no longer just for the crypto market. Data First Circle reported total revenue of $658.1 million in 2Q25 (+53% YoY). The revenue mix is ​​very conservative. Reserve income (T-Bills + interest on cash) is $634.3 million, other revenues of $23.8 million are from the network (subscription & services + transaction fees). Transaction distribution costs reached $406.9 million (+64% YoY), which reflects both a higher volume of USDC in circulation and a higher share of “on-platform” holding with partners and new distribution agreements. After deducting these costs, RLDC comes to $251.1 million, or a margin of 38%. Proportionally, this means that for every $1 (revenue + reverse income) after deducting distribution and transaction costs, $0.38 remains to cover OPex. These then jumped to $576.7 million in the last quarter, but the majority is a one-time item ( IPO ). Stock-based compensation alone is $435 million. The core of OPex is payroll and other compensation costs of $503.4 million, including SBC. Then there is G&A of $43.1 million, depreciation of $14.2 million, IT of $8.8 million, and marketing of $7.9 million. Circle ended up with a loss of $-325.6 million. The company’s post-IPO balance sheet is massive, but the structure is specific to any other stablecoin issuer. Total assets of $64.15 billion are impressive, but cash equivalents segregated for stablecoin holders are $61.37 billion. Then there are some cash equivalents and investments at the corporate level. When we add it all up, we have cash just over $1 billion, and the company’s overall debt is low. Management is targeting full-year 2025 revenue of $75 million. up to $85 million excluding reserve income. He would like to keep the margin at 36-38%, and OPex in the range of $475 million to $490 million. This is essential to our idea, because even if reserve income starts to gradually weaken due to rates, the company is aiming to create a solid revenue mix, which will shift mainly to a transaction-oriented structure. At the same time, management is interested in keeping OPex under control. Example from F24: How CRCL makes money (AppEconomyInsights) How To Price a Stablecoin Issuer It’s quite a challenge to get a valuation for Circle, as there’s not much to compare it to. However, I look at Circle through metrics that are appropriate for a stablecoin issuer. The cornerstone is RLDC (Revenue Less Distribution Costs), which is essentially gross profit after paying distribution and partnership costs. In 2Q25, Circle had total revenue of $658.1 million and RLDC of $251.1 million, along with EBITDA of $125.8 million. With a current market cap of roughly $31 billion and very low corporate debt (approximately $1.1 billion), my EV comes out to somewhere around $30.4 billion. The reserves covering USDC are segregated and are offset by corresponding liabilities, so I don’t include them in the EV. The multiples that are an approximation of Q2 until we have a longer time series are as follows: EV/TRRI = 11.6x (gross EV/Sales) proxy EV/RLDC = 30.3x (closer to reality because it reflects the shared economy of distribution costs) EV/EBITDA = 60x (very high so far, but Q2 EBITDA is after distribution and before the IPO-SBC shock costs) We are also interested in the multiples specific to stablecoins: EV/USDC = 0.5x (the market pays approximately $0.5 EV for every dollar of stable float) EV/Meaningful Wallets = $5300 (price per active address, useful as a rough estimate for network monetization over time) How USDC growth (Circle.com) If we wanted to compare Circle with indirect competition that we already have on the exchange, we can interpret the data as follows: Coinbase(NASDAQ: COIN ) - EV/Revenue at approximately 10 to 11x, EV/EBITDA at approximately 35x and EV/S + EV/TRRI is like Circle, except that COIN is purely transactional, without a carry trade on rates. Then we can compare Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), which has EV/Revenue as 2x. It has low multiples, and it is a mature business model, but it is without a significant \"network carry\" with a different margin structure. And lastly, I would mention omni-fintech Block (NYSE: XYZ ), which has EV/Revenue of 1.7x and again it is a traditional payments/e-commerce mix, which is traded at low multiples. For a fresh IPO without a long history, it is fair to use EV/RDLC and its multiples from the network instead of the classic EV/Sales. In this world, Circle is not cheap, but it is not expensive compared to COIN, if we believe in longer-term higher rates and that the FIS channel will bring monetization outside of revenue from reserves. Compared to large payment channels like PYPL and Block, we pay a premium for growth and the creation of new channels. It has its drawbacks, but I believe that the Fed will keep rates higher for a longer period of time, and that FIS will lead to better monetization of the network, which is why I remain BUY, which is close to STRONG BUY. However, it would need a stronger push to the goal in the form of faster adoption at STRONG BUY. Regulation, Rates, Adoption My investment thesis could be disrupted in the event of regulatory changes and rule fragmentation. US stablecoins are heading towards federal regulation, but for now they are subject to a mix of federal/state regulations (NYDFS, daily liquidity, instant convertibility), while on the other hand the EU is already running MiCA with its own licensing and security requirements. If the final US framework deviates significantly from the EU one, Circle may face a dual product solution (higher costs, slower roll-in to bank integrations). For the investor, there is then the risk of a binary development, where a regulatory inhomogeneous environment will reduce multiples, and different regimes will put margins under pressure. As many other analysts have already mentioned, there is also interest rate risk . My thesis assumes that the Fed will not rush to raise rates due to inflation. However, if the data improves and a faster rate-cut cycle comes, then the yield from reserves will compress faster than monetization on FIS transactions is built. This would pull down TRRI and narrow RLDC's margin despite higher distribution costs. So, it is important to watch the short end of the curve and the overall consensus of economists for rate cuts this year. I would also like to not forget about the execution risks on the part of the company. 2Q25 showed strong total revenue, but after paying partners and covering transaction costs, RLDC remained at $251 billion. If the bank integration via FID gets underway with a higher partner \"take rate\" and volumes grow slower than expected, RLDC's margin may temporarily decline further. In addition, competition in the form of Theter ( USDT ) will put pressure on the price. This is the most significant risk for me at this point that can throw off my thesis. Trigger Points In the short term, the price may fluctuate mainly based on several key moments . If Circle soon gets into major indices such as MSCI world( URTH ) or Russell2000 ( IWM ), it will trigger mandatory passive purchases and a more permanent influx of liquidity, which often keeps the share price at a new price level. Another catalyst is enterprise adoption, as soon as ISDC is natively installed in treasury/ERP systems (SAP, NetSuite, Helios) and Circle shows the first case studies from corporate payments, the “crypto” will become a regular operational money rail for B2B. Another impetus for a more dynamic movement of the share price may come from remittance corridors with large telco/fintech wallets in Latin America and Asia. Zero or low fees and guaranteed settlement can quickly add volumes outside the crypto-dative channel. The last strong impetus would be a shift to almost real-time reporting of reserves and the adoption of a tougher external audit. Better transparency usually reduces the discount to the competition and could trigger a re-rating for fresh IPOs. Once more conservative money sees this, there will be an influx of capital. I'm Buying Now.. So why BUY and not STRONG BUY, that's what I want to talk about in the comments. My investment thesis is relatively simple. Circle today is based on two engines that overlap. The first is the carry-trade of reserve yields, which I think will not just disappear due to stubborn inflation and a cautious Fed. The second is the monetization of the network, USDC is growing in circulation and volume and thanks to FIS it is moving from the crypto world to the banking world. After a quick pullback to $130 per share, I see an asymmetric opportunity for entry. If reserve yields fail due to rate cuts, transactions will come, but in my realistic scenario both engines will run simultaneously. Yes, regulation, rate-cuts, and poor take-rate execution are real risks, but that is why it makes sense for me to look at Circle through the lens of EV/RLDC and EV/USDC. An external game changer would be inclusion in indexes, or adoption into ERP/Treasury. But I'm interested in your counterargument regarding the rate cut, if it really happens, by how much? Will a 25bps cut really hurt Circle that much? How quickly will we see the first adoptions in large enterprises? And where do you think RLDC margins can go if banking channels are educated?",

        "BODY": "The presale is down to its final hours, and Bitcoin Penguins is flying. Over $4.7m has already been raised at just $0.00198, with weekly Bitcoin giveaways and the penguin meme craze pulling in traders by the thousands. Next comes the real test: a DEX launch on September 2nd, with exchange listings expected to follow. FOMO is peaking as latecomers scramble for the last tokens before trading begins. What sets this apart is the formula — viral penguin energy fused with Bitcoin branding and a roadmap anchored by the BTC-BPENGU trading pair. Pudgy Penguins lit the spark on Solana. Now Bitcoin Penguins is taking the meme meta to another level. The countdown is almost over. When the bell rings, the market decides. What is Bitcoin Penguins? Penguins have become the meta of 2025. With $1.9 billion in market cap, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) appreciated by over 580% earlier this year, proving that dynamic marketing and a well known NFT and merchandise brand can carry serious weight. Bitcoin Penguins is the next spin on this trend, but with a sharper hook: it’s Bitcoin-inspired, launching with a BTC-BPENGU pair on the roadmap, plus staking rewards of up to 100% APY, BTC giveaways, and an outrageous mission to “buy Antarctica” and create a penguin sanctuary. PENGU is already established, with a high market cap and the consequent limited upside, while Bitcoin Penguins is in the last chance presale stage with upside intact. What keeps the snowball rolling, though, is marketing. The team has gone all-in on visibility with weekly Bitcoin giveaways, nonstop campaigns, and a lineup of KOLs blasting BPENGU across X and YouTube . For meme coins, hype is liquidity, and Bitcoin Penguins is manufacturing both at scale. Bitcoin Penguins price prediction: Why dips feed the penguin meta Crypto just ate a $900M wipeout as Bitcoin slid below $109k, erasing every post-Jackson Hole gain. Red on the charts usually kills momentum, but meme coins have a way of flipping red candles into moonshots. Fundamentals haven’t saved anyone in this flush, but meme coins continue to send. Pepe has ripped an absurd 17878% since its ATL two years ago, shrugging off every macro headwind along the way. However endless frog and dog memes have had their day and penguins are next in line. Bitcoin Penguins presale has already smashed past $4.7m, but what matters is how this pump gets leveraged once trading goes live in a few hours. The weekly Bitcoin giveaways have built a sticky loop of attention, the KOL push ensures visibility won’t fade after the presale closes, and the staking pools give holders a reason to sit tight instead of dumping on day one. Now is a massive opportunity to get in on the Bitcoin Penguins presale before altcoin season really kicks in. Frogs proved a meme can run 100x in rough markets, but a Bitcoin-inspired penguin, with traction already in hand, could run even louder. Final hours: Bitcoin Penguin presale is still on The presale closes on August 27, and the September 2 DEX debut is already drawing whispers of bigger listings to follow. For meme coins, the only entries that matter are the early ones. And right now, Bitcoin Penguins is still at a presale price of only $0.00198. Rate cuts aren’t here just yet, but September is when sentiment can snap, and when it does, meme coins could be the first green candles on the board. Right now, a low-cap meme coin like Bitcoin Penguins is ready for take off. Everyone wishes they could have been early on meme coins like Pepe or Pengu, this is the final chance to grab Bitcoin Penguins at a bargain price. By the time September volatility hits, the penguin trade will already be live on the open market. Visit the official website to buy into the Bitcoin Penguins presale before it the open market.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Unicoin SEC Lawsuit: Urgent Bid for Dismissal The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the latest development concerning the Unicoin SEC lawsuit . Unicoin is making a bold move, announcing its intention to ask a court to dismiss the lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This action highlights a growing tension between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies, raising crucial questions about how digital assets are classified and overseen. What’s Behind the Unicoin SEC Lawsuit Dismissal Bid? Unicoin’s decision to seek dismissal stems from a fundamental disagreement with the SEC’s interpretation of its operations. The company argues that the agency misinterpreted its key disclosures, which are vital documents explaining its token and business model. Furthermore, Unicoin has made a serious accusation, claiming that then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler initiated a baseless lawsuit against it, driven by political reasons rather than legitimate regulatory concerns. The SEC’s initial complaint against Unicoin was significant. The agency alleged that Unicoin deceived investors by making claims that its token was backed by real-world assets, including real estate. The SEC also contended that Unicoin raised over $100 million through the sale of unregistered securities, a major violation under U.S. law. This legal battle is shaping up to be a pivotal case for the future of asset-backed tokens. Unicoin’s Defense: Misinterpretation or Misconduct? At the heart of Unicoin’s defense is the assertion that the SEC simply misunderstood how its token and backing mechanisms operate. They believe their disclosures were clear, and the agency’s interpretation was flawed. This isn’t just a minor disagreement; it challenges the very foundation of the SEC’s case. Key points from Unicoin’s perspective include: Misinterpreted Disclosures: Unicoin maintains that its public statements and documentation accurately reflected its token’s structure and backing. They argue the SEC failed to grasp these details correctly. Political Motivations: The claim of political motivations against a former SEC Chair adds another layer of complexity. If proven, it could significantly weaken the SEC’s standing in the case, suggesting an overreach of power. The company aims to present compelling evidence to the court, demonstrating that the SEC’s allegations lack a solid legal basis. The outcome of this specific Unicoin SEC lawsuit will undoubtedly influence how similar cases are handled in the future. The Stakes of the Unicoin SEC Lawsuit: What Does This Mean for Crypto? This legal confrontation extends far beyond Unicoin itself. It represents a broader struggle within the cryptocurrency industry concerning regulatory clarity. The SEC’s stance on what constitutes a “security” in the digital asset space has been a consistent point of contention for many projects. If Unicoin succeeds in its dismissal bid, it could set an important precedent. Consider these broader implications: Definition of Securities: The case could further clarify or complicate the definition of a security when applied to asset-backed tokens. This clarity is desperately needed by developers and investors alike. Regulatory Overreach: Unicoin’s accusation of political motives touches on concerns about potential regulatory overreach. A successful dismissal could encourage other projects to challenge SEC actions more aggressively. Investor Confidence: While legal battles can cause uncertainty, a clear resolution, especially one favoring the project, could boost investor confidence in properly structured asset-backed tokens. The crypto community is watching closely, understanding that the resolution of the Unicoin SEC lawsuit could shape future regulatory landscapes for innovative blockchain projects. Navigating Regulatory Waters: Lessons from the Unicoin SEC Lawsuit For other crypto projects, the ongoing Unicoin SEC lawsuit offers valuable lessons. Operating in the rapidly evolving digital asset space requires a proactive and meticulous approach to compliance and disclosure. Here are some actionable insights: Crystal-Clear Disclosures: Ensure all project documentation, whitepapers, and public statements are unambiguous and legally sound. Anticipate potential misinterpretations and address them proactively. Robust Legal Counsel: Engage experienced legal professionals specializing in blockchain and securities law from the outset. Their expertise is invaluable in navigating complex regulatory frameworks. Engagement with Regulators: Where possible, seek to engage with regulatory bodies to understand their perspectives and ensure compliance, even if formal guidance is still developing. By taking these steps, projects can better prepare for potential scrutiny and mitigate risks, ultimately fostering a more secure and compliant ecosystem. In conclusion, Unicoin’s bold move to seek dismissal of the SEC lawsuit marks a significant moment in cryptocurrency regulation. The company’s arguments—centered on alleged misinterpretations of disclosures and claims of political motivation—challenge the very basis of the SEC’s enforcement action. The outcome of this case will not only determine Unicoin’s future but also send powerful signals across the entire digital asset industry regarding regulatory boundaries and the treatment of innovative token structures. It’s an urgent situation that demands attention from all stakeholders in the crypto space, as it could redefine how asset-backed tokens are perceived and regulated moving forward.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Binance Alpha HEMI: Exciting New Perpetual Contract Listing Unveiled Are you ready for the next big opportunity in decentralized finance? Binance Alpha, the innovative on-chain trading platform, has just made an exciting announcement that has the crypto world buzzing: the upcoming Binance Alpha HEMI listing and the launch of its perpetual futures contract. This development marks a significant moment for traders looking to access early-stage tokens and expand their portfolios with potentially high-growth assets. What is Binance Alpha and the HEMI Listing Event? Binance Alpha serves as a specialized on-chain trading platform integrated seamlessly within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem. Its primary mission is to provide a dedicated gateway for users to discover and trade early-stage tokens that hold significant, often untapped, potential. These are typically projects that are still developing but show promise, offering a unique investment opportunity for those willing to engage with newer assets. The platform recently confirmed that it will officially add HEMI to its roster on August 29 at 4:00 a.m. UTC . This highly anticipated addition means that users will soon be able to access HEMI directly through Binance Alpha. Following closely, just 30 minutes later, at 4:30 a.m. UTC , traders will gain access to the HEMI/USDT perpetual futures contract . This dual launch provides both direct token access and advanced trading options for the community. Why is the HEMI Perpetual Contract a Game Changer? The introduction of a perpetual futures contract for HEMI on Binance Alpha truly opens up new and dynamic avenues for traders. Perpetual contracts are a highly popular and flexible financial instrument within the cryptocurrency market. They allow traders to speculate on the future price movements of an asset without the traditional constraint of an expiry date, offering continuous trading opportunities. This innovative feature means: Enhanced Market Liquidity: Perpetual contracts typically attract substantial trading volume, which often translates into better liquidity for the underlying asset. This makes it easier for traders to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. Strategic Leveraged Trading: Traders can utilize leverage to amplify their positions, potentially increasing their profits from smaller price movements. However, it is paramount to remember that leverage also significantly magnifies potential losses, requiring careful risk management. Efficient Price Discovery: The futures market plays a crucial role in efficient price discovery, especially for nascent or early-stage tokens like HEMI. It helps in establishing a more robust market valuation as demand and supply forces interact. Understanding these benefits, alongside the inherent risks, is key to navigating the new Binance Alpha HEMI trading environment effectively. Navigating Early-Stage Tokens: The Binance Alpha Approach Binance Alpha distinguishes itself by focusing exclusively on early-stage tokens. This strategy, while offering exciting prospects, comes with specific considerations that traders must acknowledge. Being listed on Alpha can indeed provide a token with early exposure, fostering community growth and potentially acting as a springboard for wider adoption. However, it is absolutely vital for all traders to understand a key disclaimer: A listing on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a subsequent listing on Binance’s main spot or perpetual futures markets. This distinction is incredibly important for managing expectations and understanding the platform’s specific role within the broader Binance ecosystem. Therefore, before engaging with any asset, including the Binance Alpha HEMI contract, traders are strongly advised to conduct their own comprehensive and diligent research.

These are essential for protecting your capital from significant and unexpected market downturns, preserving your trading equity.

Market dynamics for new tokens can change rapidly, and staying updated is key.

        "BODY": "Tokenization platform Securitize has predicted that Ethereum will be the future hub for real-world asset (RWA) markets, pointing to the blockchain’s dominance in institutional adoption and its potential to capture a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. In a guest thread posted on Ethereum’s X account , Carlos Domingo, CEO and founder of Securitize, pointed out the tokenization market’s growth to a $26.5 billion sector, with Ethereum hosting $7.5 billion worth of tokenized RWAs and $5.3 billion in tokenized Treasuries, giving it a 72% market share of on-chain Treasuries. “It’s where institutions are deploying capital,” the company wrote, adding that even a 1% slice of the $20 trillion-plus RWA opportunity could unlock over $200 billion in on-chain value. Domingo described 2025 as the year “RWAs found real utility onchain,” highlighting daily dividend payouts, programmability, and faster settlement as key institutional incentives to adopt tokenization. Global market overview of the total RWA value. Source: RWA.xyz Ethereum’s grip on RWA tokenization Ethereum has emerged as the leading blockchain for tokenized RWAs by market capitalization. According to data from RWA.xyz , the network accounts for more than half of all tokenized assets, with over $7.5 billion minted on its mainnet. The share expands further when factoring in Ethereum Layer 2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum , Mantle, and Optimism, which together with the main chain, account for around 85% of Securitize’s tokenized assets on Ethereum’s Mainnet. Industry analysts say Ethereum’s dominance is a product of its deep liquidity pools, composability with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and regulatory-ready token standards such as ERC-1400 and ERC-3643. “Ethereum offers some of the most secure, composable, and censorship-resistant foundations for tokenized financial products,” Domingo noted in the thread. Securitize backs institutional adoption to gather pace Global market overview of the total RWA value, excluding stablecoin data. Source: RWA.xyz Major asset managers are already experimenting with tokenization at scale, and almost all of the flagship projects are anchored on Ethereum. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, issued mostly on Ethereum via Securitize, has grown to more than $2.4 billion, making it the single largest tokenized Treasury vehicle on-chain. Apollo’s $110 million ACRED private credit fund and VanEck’s $75 million VBILL tokenized Treasury are also live on Ethereum, alongside Hamilton Lane’s $9.6 million SCOPE vehicle. Securitize itself has helped mint over $3.36 billion in tokenized assets, becoming the world’s largest tokenization platform. More than $2.3 billion out of the $3.36 billion sits on Ethereum. The firm also claims the distinction of having five tokenized RWAs worth more than $100 million, the most of any provider. For institutions, the pitch that draws them to the blockchain goes beyond cost savings. Domingo pointed out that when asset managers see they can distribute dividends daily instead of quarterly, “they immediately see the opportunity.” He described that shift in settlement cycles and value delivery as a “lightbulb moment” for Wall Street. Domingo notes that utility, liquidity, and composability with DeFi protocols will define the next phase of tokenization. In practice, this could mean equities and credit instruments being used in DeFi lending markets, or funds tapping tokenized assets to optimize capital efficiency. “Trillions will be tokenized on Ethereum because it’s instant, programmable, and always on,” the Securitize founder said, adding that the infrastructure for mainstream adoption is now in place.

        "BODY": "Ethereum has often led the way in digital transactions and new tech. Quiet competitors, working in the background, now start to draw attention. These projects use smart methods to take value from Ethereum’s success. Are these the future winners few notice? Stay tuned to uncover which hidden forces are making quiet profits from Ethereum’s achievements. Sui (SUI) Source: TradingView SUI trades between $3.38 and $3.92 after a rough stretch. The token is down 5.83% in the past week and 18.39% in a month, erasing much of the winter rally. Even so, the six-month chart still shows a 17.67% gain, proving buyers are not gone. The 10-day average sits at $3.41, a tad under the 100-day line at $3.60. RSI holds at 44.54, almost neutral, while a negative MACD echoes cooling momentum. The Stochastic reading of 64.41 hints at room to move either way. In short, short-term mood is cautious, longer-term trend is alive. Bulls need a clean push above $4.15. A break could open the door to $4.70, a jump of roughly 20% to 35% from today’s lower band. Failing that, $3.07 is the first backstop; slipping under it may drag SUI to $2.53, about a 25% slide. Expect tight action near $3.40 until volume picks a side. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Hyperliquid (HYPE) Source: TradingView HYPE trades between $41.97 and $48.51 this week. Price is up 7.45% in 7 days and 7.36% in 30 days. The big move is the 137.67% jump over 6 months. This shows steady demand after the long climb. The token now sits above both its 10 day and 100 day moving lines at $45.78 and $44.67. That shows near term strength. Momentum gauges print 61.97 on the strength index and 88.34 on the stochastic meter, hinting at heated buying but not yet at peak euphoria. Traders watch $50.99 as the next roof while $37.91 acts as the main floor. If buyers push through $50.99, HYPE could sprint another 11% to that level and then aim for $57.53, a further 26% from today. Failure to clear $50 could send price back to the 10 day line near $45 and later the $37.91 support, a slide of about 17%. Given the strong half year trend and firm moving lines, odds still lean toward a climb, but the gap to resistance grows narrower by the day. According cryptona Hype price prediction models, the DeFi token shows potential for continued upward momentum. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Source: TradingView PENGU spent the week drifting inside $0.03 to $0.04, down 1.37% since last Monday and nursing a harsh 26.89% fall over the past month. Zoom out and the mood changes; the token still shows a 267.70% gain in six months, keeping long term holders firmly in the green. The 10 day and 100 day averages both sit at $0.03, showing price equilibrium. Momentum gauges line up neutral, with RSI 46.69 and a slightly bearish MACD reading. Stochastic 64.93 hints that buyers still have some room before hitting overbought territory. In short, PENGU is coiling and waiting for a clear catalyst. A decisive close above $0.04 would flip that level into support and open a sprint toward $0.05, a move worth roughly 25%. Break that and the rally could accelerate as momentum traders pile in. Failure to hold $0.03 could drag the token toward $0.02, trimming about 33% from the current range. The tight structure suggests an explosive move is near; bulls retain the longer term edge but bears control the short term tape until 0.04 gives way. Conclusion SUI, HYPE, and PENGU show solid momentum. XYZVerse dominates the spotlight—first all-sport memecoin aiming for 20,000% gains through community-driven sports-meme fusion, early presale access, and ambitious GameFi roadmap.

        "BODY": "Investors are keeping a close eye on digital coins that could grow soon. XRP and Chainlink have both shown strong movement and may soon see gains. However, a new project called XYZVerse (XYZ) is getting even more attention. Market watchers are starting to wonder if this could be the next breakout coin this quarter. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between $2.83 and $3.17. The token slipped 4.06% in the past 7 days and 7.23% in the past month, yet it still shows a 33.60% gain over 6 months. This mix of short-term weakness and long-term strength keeps traders alert. The 10-day average sits at $2.91, a shade under the 100-day average at $2.99, hinting at mild downward pressure. Momentum gauges look mixed: the relative strength score is a balanced 55.4, while the fast oscillator is a lofty 91.0, signaling the market is running hot. With the moving averages so close and the trend lines flat, XRP waits for a catalyst. If buyers push above $3.17, the first test is $3.32. A close there would add about 5% from current levels and open a path to $3.66, roughly 15% higher. Failure to clear $3.17 invites a slide to the $2.63 support, about an 8% dip, and in a deeper pullback $2.29, near 20% lower. Given the six-month uptrend and firm support pockets, odds still lean to a steady climb, but the next few sessions must confirm it. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView LINK trades in a band between $23.52 and $28.00. The token fell 6.51% this week after soaring 30.96% over the past month and 57.89% across six months. Momentum cooled, but the big picture stays positive. Bulls are digesting gains and sellers have yet to push price below the lower $20s. The 10-day average sits at $23.72 while the 100-day line is higher at $25.31, so short trend lags the broader rise. Immediate support rests at $21.21 and deeper backing shows at $16.73. Resistance stands at $30.17, then $34.65. RSI near 54 looks balanced, but a high stochastic hints at limited room before another pause. If buyers clear $30.17 the move could add about 20% and lift LINK toward $34.65. Failing that, slipping under $21.21 risks a 10% dip, and losing $16.73 opens a fall of roughly 30%. With mixed signals, a slow grind toward the high $20s looks slightly more likely than a deep pullback. However, according cryptona Link long time forecast, the oracle network's expanding utility could drive higher targets. Conclusion XRP and LINK look set to double amid the 2025 bull run, yet the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) targets 20,000% growth, blending sports fandom, community rewards and GameFi roadmap.

        "SOURCE_ID": 65,
        "BODY": "Forbes contributor Zennon Kapron has outlined what the next five years could look like for XRP, following the resolution of its legal battle with the SEC. In August 2025, the SEC and Ripple dismissed their appeals, leaving intact the 2023 ruling that sales of XRP on public exchanges are not securities. This outcome has lifted a major barrier to institutional adoption. It allows XRP to reassert itself as one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.XRP’s Current Market PositionCurrently, XRP is trading at $3, with a market cap of around $179 billion, ranking it among the top three digital assets. Daily trading volume regularly surpasses $6 billion, while improved liquidity metrics make it more viable for larger institutional orders.Its price now hovers close to levels last seen during the 2017–2018 bull cycle amid renewed investor confidence in the token.Utility and Adoption OutlookThe Forbes article noted that XRP’s next phase will be determined by its use in payments beyond speculation. It cited an estimate of over $5 by Finder as XRP price by 2030, but most would suggest this is a bearish outlook especially considering XRP's drivers identified by the Forbes report. For one, the XRP Ledger, optimized for low-cost and fast settlement, added an automated market maker (AMM) in 2024 to deepen liquidity. According to XRPScan data, AMMs have accumulated over 11.7 million XRP tokens across 22,035 active pools.Meanwhile, Forbes noted that Ripple Payments (formerly RippleNet) now covers more than 90 markets and supports settlements in fiat currencies, stablecoins, and XRP. Corridors like Japan–Philippines and Africa’s Onafriq are already leveraging XRP. As a result, broader adoption could be driven by cost-cutting in remittances, which exceeded $685 billion globally in 2024, with average fees around 6%.Institutional Demand and ETFsThe report also noted that Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, custodied by BNY, is aimed at attracting institutions. They have the flexibility to route some transactions through XRP when it proves more efficient.Further, other avenues to generate demand for XRP include ETFs. The report highlighted that multiple filings for U.S. spot XRP ETFs could unlock a new demand channel, similar to what happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.Forbes’ Five-Year Outlook for XRPAccording to the analysis, XRP’s upside lies in its newfound legal clarity, expanding payment corridors, and growing liquidity. These factors make it more attractive for payments and investment products.However, competition from stablecoins, central bank digital currencies, and upgrades to existing systems like SWIFT could limit adoption.Regarding XRP's five-year outlook, Forbes cited a Finder expert panel in July 2025, which predicted that XRP would trade at $2.80 by year-end and $5.25 by 2030.It said whether XRP realizes that trajectory depends largely on how much of Ripple’s payment flows pass through XRP rather than fiat or stablecoins.Meanwhile, other industry publications have also issued XRP price forecasts for 2030, most of which are optimistic. Bitwise, for example, expects XRP to trade at $29 by 2030. Telgaon predicts $48, while Changelly forecasts $23. Meanwhile, prominent voices in the XRP community have set much higher targets, such as $100 and beyond.Forbes concludes that with legal uncertainty resolved, XRP has a stronger footing. Yet, its long-term role will depend on adoption in real-world corridors and institutional access through capital markets.",

        "BODY": "Metaplanet, a Japan-based and publicly traded company, has announced a new strategy that will attract attention in the cryptocurrency markets. Japanese Company Metaplanet Prepares to Acquire Bitcoin with $881 Million in Share Issuance The company plans to raise 130.334 billion yen (about $881 million) through an international stock offering. The majority of the funds will be directed toward direct Bitcoin investments. According to the company's statement, 123.818 billion yen ($837 million) of the capital to be collected will be used for Bitcoin acquisitions between September and October 2025. The remaining 6.516 billion yen ($44 million) will be allocated to the development of Bitcoin-focused financial operations. Metaplanet is one of the Asian companies that has been making headlines recently for its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. The company currently holds 18,991 Bitcoins. The total value of these assets is estimated at approximately 314.6 billion yen as of August 25, 2025. Experts interpret Metaplanet's move as part of a growing trend toward Bitcoin being favored by institutional treasuries. The adoption of this strategy, particularly one pioneered by MicroStrategy, in Japan could boost institutional investor interest in the region. Company officials emphasize that the new investments are made within the scope of a long-term strategy and that Metaplanet aims to position Bitcoin as a “core reserve asset” on its balance sheet. This development is seen as a new milestone in the global institutional adoption of Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "Crypto analyst StephIsCrypto has published a brief but pointed update on XRP, describing what he sees as “The final wave for #XRP” and adding the directive to “Prepare accordingly!” The post , shared on X, was accompanied by a chart projection that outlined a sharp rise in XRP’s value followed by a multi-year decline. The final wave for #XRP Prepare accordingly! pic.twitter.com/eOAww7AWyM — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 26, 2025 The XRP Chart Outlook The attached chart was derived from OKX’s weekly XRP/USDT frame, extending from mid-2024 through 2027. It included vertical green bands marking a highlighted period in late 2025, with the date October 27, 2025, displayed at the bottom. A white line was sketched across the price area to visualize the analyst’s forecast. According to the illustration, XRP is expected to climb aggressively into the highlighted period, peaking around late October 2025. The hand-drawn curve showed the peak occurring in the low-to-mid double digits, after which the projection turned decisively lower. The downward path extended through 2026 and into 2027, with the implied price eventually returning close to the lower end of the scale, suggesting a significant retracement following the anticipated top. StephIsCrypto did not provide further explanation or a breakdown of catalysts in the post itself. The phrasing of “final wave” and the emphasis on preparation positions the update as a warning, while the chart supplies the visual representation of the scenario. Without detailed targets or technical reasoning attached, the forecast remains directional in nature rather than prescriptive, focusing on the idea of one last strong rally followed by a long-term decline. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses The post drew mixed responses. One user, DeadMoreThanU, dismissed the concept of a “final wave,” arguing that XRP and the XRPL will continue to build momentum across global markets. Lucy responded by saying she was already committed regardless of whether the move turns out to be the final stage or not. RenderDamo criticized the prospect of a $20 price target, calling it unrealistic and suggesting XRP would be fortunate to reach $7 at the top . Tony Blom countered by saying traditional cycle patterns no longer apply, claiming that future movements will be shaped by utility, institutional adoption, and ETF involvement, with speculation playing a smaller role than in previous years. The post offers a stark scenario for XRP holders, highlighting late 2025 as a decisive time before a multi-year decline. While the specifics remain undefined, the projection itself conveys a cautious stance, urging market participants to be prepared for what the analyst believes could be XRP’s most significant and possibly last major cycle rally.

        "BODY": "The current sideways price development surrounding XRP offers a rare buying opportunity, and a notable pundit reveals he is not taking it for granted. For context, XRP reclaimed $3 on Tuesday, posting its first green candle in four days. This temporary setback follows a broader market trend, spurred by macroeconomic headwinds and profit-taking crypto whales.Nonetheless, the brief decline to $2.82 two days ago presented a good opportunity, one that XRP enthusiasts claimed was another chance to buy at a low price. The sentiment springs from a growing belief that XRP will launch into uncharted territories in the near term.Dips Are for Buying More XRP: PunditContent creator DustyBC Crypto shares this sentiment, advocating for buying the XRP dip in his recent post . He disclosed that he is already taking this approach and is stacking the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at this price discount “like there is no tomorrow.”Fueling this sentiment is his belief that the current XRP trend between $2 and $3 shares a similarity with the token’s price between $0.45 and $0.55. Notably, XRP has fluctuated between $2 and $3 for the greater part of the last nine months, and the enthusiast believes it is the new $0.45 to $0.55.The comparison suggests that XRP will break out of its current range, as it did after consolidating between $0.45 and $0.55 for years, to target higher prices. Remarkably, XRP surged 500% from $0.50 in November 2024 to $3.40 in January, when it broke out of the range, and a similar rally would likely take XRP to double digits.Meanwhile, DustyBC insinuated that the rally would happen in no time, adding that he cannot wait for the next XRP uptrend to start. This also aligns with the strengthening conviction within the XRP community that XRP’s bull cycle is not over yet.Aligning Views on The XRP DipInterestingly, several other analysts share DustyBC Crypto's view that the XRP dip is a rare opportunity. Alex Cobb recently called the XRP drop below $3 unreal , insisting that it is a “psyop to try and steal your coins.”The analyst further urged XRP holders not to sell “the greatest investment of all time” to prominent institutions like BlackRock. He also predicted a rebound to $3.60 before the end of August.Meanwhile, Coach JV called acquiring XRP below $3 a massive blessing . He emphasized that it is during market uncertainties that real investors create generational wealth. Specifically, they buy the fears and reap the reward for their resilience when the market rebounds.Moreover, a recent report has highlighted the benefits of buying during uncertain times and holding XRP on a long-term basis. The analysis reveals that those who bought and still hold their XRP over the past year have seen their portfolio grow by 5.168 times, representing an increase of over 410%.",

        "BODY": "Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) have booked profits at an almost unprecedented level, outpacing even the 2021 bull market in realized gains. On-chain data shows long-term holders have offloaded more BTC this cycle than at any point except the frenzied peak of 2017, adding weight to warnings that the number one cryptocurrency may be entering the late phase of its ongoing bull run. Historic Profit-Taking and Shifting Sentiment According to analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin LTHs, entities holding the asset for more than 155 days, have realized profits totaling 3.27 million BTC sold. This is only second to the 3.93 million BTC that changed hands between 2016 and 2017, pointing to intense selling pressure from the network’s most resilient participants. “Taken alongside other signals, this suggests the market has entered a late phase of the cycle.” Glassnode’s analysts remarked. In another post, they noted that profit realization has coincided with slowing network activity. According to them, the monthly average of adjusted transfer volume fell 13% this month, sliding from $26.7 billion to $23.2 billion. Additionally, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio hit its lowest point since November 2021, according to CryptoQuant, with analysts interpreting this divergence between price and sentiment as a sign of weakening speculative demand. Cycle analysis further strengthens the case that Bitcoin may be nearing its apex. Analyst Cryptobirb argued on August 25 that the bull cycle, which began after the April 2024 halving, is already 93% complete. Based on historical halving-linked cycles, he projected that a blow-off top could occur between late October and mid-November 2025. Despite these pressures, some indicators show resilience. Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. highlighted that the annual Adjusted MVRV ratio has compressed to the neutral 1.0 level, signaling that short-term profit-taking has cooled without breaking the broader uptrend. “The market is digesting the previous rally rather than reversing,” he noted on X. Market Watch Bitcoin has already pulled back more than 10% from its recent all-time high above $124,000, slipping below $109,000 yesterday before recovering to around $111,300 at the time of this writing. Price action over multiple time frames reflects a market in consolidation. Over the past 24 hours, BTC edged up 1.0%, but it remains down 2.3% for the week, 6.7% over two weeks, and 7.1% for the month. Even so, the asset is still up 76% year-on-year, showing the scale of the longer-term advance. Compared with the wider crypto market, BTC dominance has held steady, suggesting investors continue to treat it as a benchmark asset during volatility.

        "BODY": "Bitcoin is trading around $111,000 after several days of losing ground below its all-time high of $124,500. Bulls have managed to keep the price above the key $110,000 support, but momentum remains weak as attempts to push higher continue to fail. Some analysts warn of a deeper correction ahead if buyers cannot step in with stronger conviction. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Risk As Binance Leverage Ratio Skyrockets To Record Levels Top analyst Axel Adler shared new insights, pointing to the behavior of Bitcoin’s annual Adjusted MVRV. Currently, the metric has pressed against the 1.0 zone, meaning the short-term average (30-day) is almost identical to the longer-term average (365-day). In practice, this shows that the market is in a balancing phase: recent profit-taking and volatility are being absorbed by the longer-term growth trend, keeping the overall structure neutral. Historically, this 1.0 level has often represented a pause within bullish cycles rather than the end of them. It signals that the market is digesting recent gains as short-term holders hand coins to longer-term investors. Whether Bitcoin breaks down to test lower demand zones or stabilizes before another leg higher will likely be decided in the coming weeks, as traders closely watch this critical support zone. Bitcoin Adjusted MVRV Signals Pause, Not Reversal According to Adler, Bitcoin’s annual Adjusted MVRV is currently pressed right at the 1.0 zone, and the dynamics behind it tell an important story. The annual basis remains positive, and its curve looks largely horizontal because two opposing forces are offsetting each other. On the one hand, the 30-day metric has cooled significantly as volatility eased and profit-taking slowed after the latest push to all-time highs. On the other, the heavier 365-day average still reflects the gains of past months, holding up the broader trend. This synchronization between numerator and denominator compresses the difference, keeping the basis line steady rather than sliding downward or accelerating upward. In simple terms, the market is digesting the previous rally rather than breaking down. Adler stresses that this situation at the 1.0 zone should not be mistaken for the end of a cycle. Instead, it represents a pause within an ongoing bullish structure. As long as the annual basis does not reverse downward, the market is essentially redistributing coins from short-term speculators into the hands of more patient holders. There are no strong signs of capitulation, only consolidation. Over the next couple of weeks, the reaction at 1.0 will be critical. Whether Bitcoin holds firm and builds momentum or slips toward deeper corrections will define the next phase. For now, Adler sees this as more a matter of time and balance than a warning of a cycle-ending reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Cost Basis Aligns With Critical Indicator: Support Builds Around $100K Level BTC Testing Support Around Pivotal Level Bitcoin continues to consolidate after a sharp retrace from its all-time high of $124K, now trading near $110,823. The daily chart shows BTC struggling to hold above the $110K support zone, which has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. The 50-day SMA is trending around $116,600, while the 100-day SMA is near $111,600—levels that are now acting as resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits lower at approximately $101,000, marking the deeper structural support. A decisive loss of the $110K zone could accelerate selling pressure, potentially leading Bitcoin to test the 100K–107K support range, a critical confluence highlighted by analysts due to the alignment with the STH Realized Price. Related Reading: Bitcoin CEX Netflows Still Green Despite Large Sellers Rotating To Ethereum On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim the $115K–$117K region to shift momentum back in favor of bulls. Failure to do so risks further consolidation and market uncertainty. The rejection at the $123K level last week highlighted strong overhead resistance, with sellers stepping in aggressively.

        "BODY": "Not every market run carries the same weight. Hedera is drawing attention as institutional pilots point toward broader adoption. XRP continues to hold ground with speculation around a spot ETF keeping energy alive. Both are moving forward, but BlockDAG is setting an entirely different standard. Instead of relying on hints and headlines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already executing. The project has shipped miners, confirmed 20 exchange listings, and activated 2.5 million users before launch. With $385 million raised in presale and a return of 2900% from the first batch, BlockDAG is not just talking about progress; it is showing it. Among top crypto performers, it is one of the few that converts plans into infrastructure while others remain tied to trials, filings, and rumor cycles. BlockDAG Turns Plans Into Action With $385M Raised and 25.4B Coins Sold Most presales ask people to picture a possible future. BlockDAG is already presenting a working model. Instead of offering sketches of roadmaps, it is providing real results. The presale is backed by functioning hardware, secured listings, live rewards, and independent audits. To begin, BlockDAG already has 2.5 million users through the X1 mobile mining app, while thousands of its X-series miners have been shipped. This proves that the project is not waiting for launch day to show activity. On top of that, 20 exchange listings are locked in, including recognized platforms like MEXC and BitMart. This ensures that once trading begins, access and liquidity are already available. Security has also been prioritized, with reviews from both CertiK and Halborn confirming the strength of its GhostDAG architecture. The presale also includes a reward system that keeps users engaged before the mainnet release. Features like Buyer Battles, referral bonuses, and the Ambassador Program provide ongoing perks and create an active community. Unlike typical presales, where people wait in silence, BlockDAG makes them part of the process. The numbers underline the scope of this progress: $385 million raised Batch 30 reached Price: $0.03 2900% ROI since batch 1 Over 25.4 billion coins sold Altogether, BlockDAG is showing a level of preparation that few presales match. While many projects remain unfinished ideas, BlockDAG is presenting itself as a working ecosystem preview. That completeness is rare in crypto and is why it continues to lead conversations about top performers. Hedera Builds Momentum With Institutional Progress Hedera has taken another step forward as the HBAR price climbed from $0.23 to $0.24. At first glance, the change looks small, but this 4% rise confirms the $0.23 level as solid support and strengthens the idea of a trading base forming in that zone. For many, holding that line is a signal of gradual but steady growth. Two institutional moves have fueled this progress. First, SWIFT launched live blockchain trials using Hedera, testing how it can handle tokenized settlement. This suggests that major financial operators are exploring Hedera for real use cases. Second, Grayscale registered a Delaware trust tied to HBAR, often viewed as preparation for a future exchange-traded product. Combined, these updates reflect a growing sense of credibility. Hedera may not be making huge price swings yet, but the involvement of major institutions gives it a stronger foundation to build from in 2025. XRP Pushes Forward With ETF Speculation XRP remains in the spotlight as attention grows around both its price and potential market catalysts. Even after a brief dip near $2.88, it has managed to hold firm support close to the $2 level. This stability is critical because it provides a launchpad for higher moves, and some analysts even project an ambitious target near $10 if momentum strengthens. Technical indicators are backing this case. While overall trading activity has cooled slightly, the funding rate is still positive, showing that long positions outnumber shorts. This is often seen as a bullish signal. At the same time, community buzz continues to build around speculation that BlackRock could be buying XRP ahead of a possible ETF filing. This mix of steady technical strength, a reliable base, and major institutional rumors has kept XRP on the radar. For many watchers, XRP feels closer to another breakout than retreat. BlockDAG Outpaces XRP and Hedera With Real Delivery Hedera and XRP are moving forward, each in their own lane. Hedera is drawing interest through institutional pilots, while XRP benefits from ETF speculation and a strong price base. Both are notable, yet BlockDAG is already showing more. With $385 million raised, ROI going past 2900%, a community of millions of users, shipped miners, and independent audits, BlockDAG has delivered what many presales only talk about. It is not waiting for approvals, filings, or market rumors to prove its case. This difference matters. Hedera and XRP are building attention, but BlockDAG is proving real capability. Among the top crypto performers of 2025, it is one of the few setting the pace through results instead of promises.

        "BODY": "The race for crypto ETFs is intensifying as two tokens, Chainlink (LINK) and XRP, come under scrutiny . Crypto asset manager Bitwise officially submitted paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, seeking to launch a Bitwise Chainlink ETF that provides investors with direct exposure to LINK, the native token of the oracle network. Bitwise Pushes Forward With Chainlink ETF Filing According to the S-1 filing, the fund will directly hold LINK, providing investors with a way to gain exposure to the token without having to purchase it directly on the open market. In practice, this means that investors can create shares using the LINK token and redeem their shares to receive LINK again, or they can complete the process in cash. Shares in the fund will also be issued and redeemed in cash, a Trust-Directed-Trade process that mirrors the structure of other spot ETFs. The SEC has only recently begun to allow issuers to offer in-kind creation and redemption for crypto-based ETFs. The Bitwise Chainlink ETF application does not yet include a ticker symbol. It does not specify the exact listing venue. Still, Bitwise plans to list the fund on a U.S. national securities exchange after obtaining approval from the SEC. The paperwork, however, shows that Coinbase Custody Trust Company would act as the custodian for the LINK tokens and also serve as the prime execution agent. Chainlink’s price action has already responded positively to the news of the Bitwise ETF application. The token is trading above $23 and has gained nearly 5% in the daily chart. Traders are now watching to see if LINK can extend its ETF momentum and push toward a price breakout to $30 if the cryptocurrency continues its uptrend. Chainlink And XRP Battle For ETF Spotlight While Chainlink is gaining attention with its ETF filing, XRP is not far behind in the race. Bitwise has filed amended S-1 forms for its XRP ETF, with key catalysts for possible SEC approval expected in October. The amendments to the XRP ETF filing were likely made in response to feedback from the SEC. If the XRP ETF follows a path similar to Ethereum’s, market experts predict approval could come first, with trading beginning about two months later. Meanwhile, if it follows the same pattern as Bitcoin ETFs, the most favorable outcome could see trading begin within just one to five days after approval, rather than waiting months. With Bitwise filing for a LINK ETF and also pursuing an XRP product, both tokens are firmly in the spotlight and could soon compete directly as regulated investment products available through spot ETFs. XRP’s price action remains steady despite waiting for ETF approval. The token is hovering near $3.22 after recently climbing to $3.60. Traders are now watching to see if XRP can break out again as the ETF review process moves forward.",

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld US Stock Indices Stumble: Analyzing Wednesday’s Lower Open The financial world began Wednesday with a notable shift as major US stock indices opened lower. This immediate dip has naturally sparked conversations among investors and market watchers alike. Understanding these movements is crucial, as they often ripple across various asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market. What Happened to US Stock Indices Today? On Wednesday, the three prominent U.S. stock indices kicked off the trading day with a decline. This collective drop indicates a cautious, if not bearish, sentiment among traders right from the opening bell. S&P 500: It saw a modest but significant decrease of -0.09% . This broad market index reflects the performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. exchanges. Nasdaq Composite: The tech-heavy index experienced a more pronounced dip of -0.15% . This movement often signals shifts in investor confidence regarding growth stocks and the technology sector. Dow Jones Industrial Average: The Dow opened lower by -0.01% . While a smaller percentage, it still contributes to the overall narrative of a market starting the day on a negative note. These initial figures, though seemingly small, set the tone for the day and are closely monitored for deeper trends. Investors often look at these early movements to gauge market sentiment. Why Did US Stock Indices Stumble at the Open? When US stock indices open lower, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, it’s often a confluence of economic indicators, corporate news, and global events. Today’s stumble could be influenced by several underlying concerns that have been brewing in the market. For instance, ongoing discussions around inflation rates and the Federal Reserve’s potential monetary policy decisions can weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Any hint of tighter financial conditions or slower economic growth can lead to a pullback in equity markets. Moreover, disappointing corporate earnings reports or revised economic forecasts can also trigger such downward movements. Geopolitical tensions, while not always directly linked to daily opens, can also create an atmosphere of uncertainty. This uncertainty encourages investors to adopt a more risk-averse stance, which often means moving away from equities. Therefore, a cautious start to the trading day for US stock indices is a reflection of these broader anxieties. The Broader Impact: How Do Lower US Stock Indices Affect You? The performance of US stock indices doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it has far-reaching implications. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this is particularly relevant. When traditional markets, especially U.S. equities, show weakness, it can sometimes influence the crypto space. Historically, there have been periods where cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown correlation with major stock indices. A decline in traditional markets might lead some investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets, which can include digital currencies. Conversely, some might see crypto as an alternative safe haven, though this view is debated and can shift. Understanding these interconnections is vital. A lower open for the S&P 500 or Nasdaq can signal a broader risk-off environment, prompting a re-evaluation of investment strategies across the board. It emphasizes the importance of a diversified portfolio and staying informed about global economic trends, not just crypto-specific news. Navigating Market Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors Facing a day when US stock indices open lower can feel unsettling, but it’s a normal part of market cycles. For both traditional and crypto investors, maintaining a clear strategy is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic news, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. These factors often provide context for market movements. Review Your Portfolio: Use such days as an opportunity to assess your risk tolerance and ensure your portfolio allocation still aligns with your long-term goals. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions during market dips can be costly. A well-researched, long-term perspective often outperforms reactive trading. Consider Diversification: A diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Remember, market fluctuations are inherent. Focusing on fundamental analysis and disciplined investing can help navigate these periods effectively. In conclusion, while the lower opening of US stock indices on Wednesday signals a cautious market sentiment, it’s crucial to look beyond the immediate numbers. Understanding the underlying reasons and broader implications empowers investors to make informed decisions. Markets are dynamic, and staying vigilant and strategic is always the best approach. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when US stock indices open lower?

Q2: How quickly do US stock indices typically recover from a lower open? A2: Recovery times vary greatly. It depends on the underlying causes of the dip and how quickly market confidence returns. Some days see a rebound, while others continue to decline. Q3: Does a lower open for US stock indices always impact cryptocurrency prices? A3: Not always directly, but there can be a correlation. During periods of broader market uncertainty or a ‘risk-off’ environment, some investors might reduce exposure to assets perceived as riskier, including cryptocurrencies. Q4: What should an average investor do when US stock indices open lower? A4: It’s generally advised to avoid impulsive decisions. Review your long-term investment strategy, stay informed about market news, and consider if your portfolio remains diversified according to your risk tolerance.

        "SOURCE_ID": 52,
        "BODY": "Total cryptocurrency flows involving Iranian entities fell to $3.7 billion between January and July 2025, representing an 11% decline compared with the same period in 2024, according to new analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. The sharpest contraction came after April, with inflows in June plunging by more than 50% year-over-year, and July volumes down over 76%. TRM said the downturn coincided with multiple shocks: the breakdown of nuclear negotiations, a 12-day conflict with Israel beginning June 13, and widespread power outages in Iran caused by Israeli kinetic and cyber operations as well as regime-initiated shutdowns. “What we are seeing in Iran is an ecosystem under severe strain from geopolitical turmoil, enforcement actions, and a loss of confidence in domestic exchanges,” TRM Labs notes in its analysis. Nobitex Remains Central Despite $90 Million Hack Despite the disruption, Nobitex, Iran’s largest exchange, continued to dominate the market in 2025. TRM data shows Nobitex processed more than 87% of Iranian-linked transaction volume, with USD 2 billion of its USD 3 billion activity flowing through the TRON network, primarily in TRC-20 USDT and TRX. However, Nobitex’s central role also amplified systemic risk. On June 18, the platform suffered a USD 90 million hack attributed to the pro-Israel group Predatory Sparrow. The incident froze liquidity, slowed transaction processing, and forced users to temporarily migrate to alternative platforms. TRM researchers noted that outflows from Nobitex surged 150% in the week leading up to the Iran–Israel conflict, as users sought safer venues. Many of these funds were redirected to global exchanges with limited Know Your Customer (KYC) controls, or to high-risk platforms operating with no KYC checks at all. Tether Freeze Deepens Market Disruption Market turbulence was compounded on July 2, 2025, when Tether froze 42 addresses linked to Iranian entities — the largest such action to date. More than half of the frozen wallets had substantial exposure to Nobitex, with some also connected to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-affiliated actors previously flagged by Israeli authorities. “The Tether freeze disrupted entrenched settlement channels and forced both retail and institutional users to rapidly diversify their stablecoin strategies,” TRM Labs said. In response, government-aligned channels and some domestic exchanges urged users to offload USDT and pivot toward DAI on the Polygon network, citing lower transaction costs and resilience against sanctions-driven freezes. Illicit Activity Low, But Crypto Remains Sanctions Tool TRM emphasized that while Iranian actors continue to leverage crypto for sanctions evasion and procurement of sensitive goods, illicit activity at Iranian exchanges accounted for just 0.9% of total volume — roughly in line with global averages. Everyday Iranians are also turning to crypto as a hedge against inflation and financial instability, despite declining trust in local platforms. “For many ordinary citizens, crypto remains an indispensable savings vehicle amid currency depreciation and limited access to international finance,” TRM reported. Nevertheless, the June hack revealed deeper structural issues. TRM analysis linked on-chain flows at Nobitex to IRGC-linked actor Amir Hossein Nikaeen Ravari and to Gaza Now, a pro-Hamas outlet sanctioned after the October 2023 attacks on Israel. Investigators also uncovered Nobitex code designed for warrantless surveillance, further eroding public trust. A Fragile but Adaptive Ecosystem Despite contraction, Iran’s crypto economy continues to adapt under pressure. Mining activity remains a core revenue source for Tehran, with TRM tracking previously dormant wallets tied to bitcoin miners moving funds into Nobitex’s new hot wallet after the hack. Meanwhile, underground networks such as Novin Verify are expanding, offering forged IDs and KYC bypass tools to sanctioned users seeking access to foreign platforms. TRM also reported the first documented cases of cryptocurrency being used to pay foreign operatives for espionage, showing crypto’s widening role in Iran’s geopolitical playbook. “While confidence in domestic exchanges is deteriorating, Iranians are demonstrating agility in migrating to new stablecoins, new chains, and new settlement methods,” TRM Labs concluded. “The ecosystem remains fragile, but highly adaptive.” The post Iran’s Crypto Flows Drop 11% in Q1 of 2025 Amid Geopolitical Strains and Exchange Hack: TRM Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",

        "BODY": "Summary ETH is a Buy for the long term, supported by strong fundamentals, ETF inflows, and growing corporate adoption, but the market feels overheated. Recent price surges are tied to Fed rate cut expectations; if the macro backdrop shifts, ETH could face sharp pullbacks and increased volatility. Ethereum's unique supply dynamics, proof-of-stake model, and expanding role in DeFi and tokenization set it apart from competitors. My strategy: wait for dips near $4,000 to accumulate ETH, as patience will offer better entry points for long-term investors amid current market exuberance. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has been on a wild ride. Just last week it touched a record high of $4,955 and today it trades around $4,600. Back in April it was only $1,383, so in six months it has more than tripled. That kind of move can either show deep conviction from big investors, or it can be the kind of run that ends with a hard pullback. In my opinion, ETH is not outrageously overpriced but I also do not see it as deeply undervalued at these levels. On the supportive side, there are big inflows from ETF inflows , companies adding ETH to their balance sheets like BitMine and Bit Digital and regulatory support such as the CFTC opening the door to spot crypto trading. What gives me pause is how much the latest surge seems tied to Fed rate cut expectations . If the macro backdrop shifts, demand for risky assets like ETH could cool fast. My view is that ETH deserves a Buy rating. The fundamentals are strong but the market feels overheated. A better strategy is to wait for dips closer to $4,000 before adding. What Ethereum Is Today Ethereum has become the platform for much of the modern crypto economy. It powers DeFi, NFTs, tokenized assets and experiments with tokenized securities . While Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, ETH looks more like digital infrastructure. The fact that some companies, such as Bit Digital, have even moved their whole treasury into ETH shows that it is starting to gain trust in the corporate world. Another reason ETH is unique is the shift to proof-of-stake, which cut new issuance. When network activity rises, ETH is actually burned, which reduces supply. That feedback loop means growth in usage directly supports the price and this feature separates Ethereum from most competitors. What the Numbers Show On-chain signs look healthy. BlackRock’s ETF now holds over 3 million ETH and corporations like SharpLink, BitMine and Bit Digital are also adding to holdings. That points to a growing pool of long-term investors. Supply on exchanges is dropping as more coins get locked away in ETFs and treasuries. Ethereum Exchange Reserve (CryptoQuant) The recent price action is telling. ETH has climbed more than 90% in six months, with clear resistance around $4,955 and support closer to $3,900. The latest rally showed how quickly demand can push prices higher when momentum is strong. But volatility remains high. Weekly swings of about 10% make it vulnerable to sharp pullbacks if the macro environment turns sour. ETHUSD Volatility (Author, YF) How ETH Is Valued The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a common crypto valuation tool, is sitting at elevated levels, which usually signals overheating. Historically, ETH has corrected after similar peaks. Even so, Ethereum’s market cap of around $550 billion is still less than a quarter of Bitcoin’s, despite ETH handling a larger share of DeFi and tokenization activity. By that measure, ETH could be seen as undervalued. ETHUSD Price & MVRV Ratio (TradingView) Looking at possible price ranges, a bearish outcome would see ETH slide into the $2,800 to $3,200 zone if risk appetite fades and ETFs see outflows. In a more neutral scenario, ETH holds steady between $4,200 and $4,600 as ETF demand continues at a moderate pace. If things break in its favor, especially with Fed cuts and strong institutional inflows, ETH could pass $5,000 and head toward $6,500. ETHUSD Price & Federal Funds Rate (Author, AlphaVantage & YF) What Could Go Wrong There are clear risks worth keeping in mind. If inflation turns higher again, the Fed may hold off on cuts and that could weigh on ETH more than most other digital assets. Regulation is moving in the right direction in the U.S. but in Europe there are warnings of a “ halo effect ” that suggest regulators are still cautious. Competitive threats from Solana and other networks are real and perhaps the most immediate concern is the simple fact that ETH has already risen nearly 100% in half a year. That kind of move often attracts speculative excess that does not last. What Lies Ahead Looking out over the next year to a year and a half, I think ETH is well positioned to benefit from the rise of tokenized securities, stablecoin payments and steady ETF inflows. These factors create a supportive base of demand. In the shorter term, however, the picture is less clear. With the market this hot, ETH could just as easily cool off if investors start doubting the Fed’s commitment to cuts. Possible Paths for ETH The range of possible paths is wide. In a bearish outcome, inflation stays sticky, the Fed delays easing, risk appetite drops and ETH could fall toward $3,000. In a base case, the Fed cuts gradually, inflows continue at a solid pace and ETH trades in the $4,200 to $4,600 zone. In a bullish case, aggressive easing combined with more corporate adoption could push ETH past $5,000 and toward $6,500. Final Take I believe ETH deserves a Buy rating, though not a Strong Buy. Its supply dynamics, institutional inflows, ETF adoption and progress on regulation all point to a strong long-term story. But with ETH sitting close to record highs after a steep climb, the risk-reward looks tilted toward waiting for better entry levels. For those who want to take a long-term position, I think the smarter play is to accumulate ETH on dips. A range between $3,800 and $4,200 looks more attractive as an entry. This cycle, in my view, gives long-term investors a rare chance to own Ethereum before tokenized finance takes hold more broadly. The key is patience: avoid chasing highs and be ready to buy when the next pullback comes.",

        "BODY": "Numerai’s native token, NMR, has recorded a sharp upswing after securing one of its largest institutional partnerships to date. The token jumped 125% in seven days, with trading volumes reaching nearly $500 million in a single day. The rally followed news that JPMorgan, one of the largest allocators to quantitative strategies, had committed $500 million of fund capacity to Numerai’s flagship hedge fund. The move marks a significant milestone for the San Francisco-based platform, which blends artificial intelligence, data science, and blockchain incentives in asset management. JPMorgan deal gives Numerai $500 million boost Numerai confirmed that JPMorgan had secured $500 million of capacity in its global equity hedge fund. The partnership arrives nearly a decade after Numerai’s launch in 2015 as an experiment in crowdsourced AI for financial trading. The platform allows data scientists worldwide to submit market signals through an open API, feeding into its fund’s trading strategies. The fund’s growth has accelerated in recent years. Assets under management rose from $60 million to $450 million in just three years. In 2024, Numerai’s fund delivered a net return of 25.45% with a Sharpe ratio of 2.75, making it the firm’s strongest year since inception, with only one month of negative performance. The announcement immediately sparked activity in crypto markets. According to data, NMR is now trading around $16.86, up sharply from earlier levels. Market watchers highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that “NMR is absolutely LIT right now, shooting skyward after the JPMorgan bombshell…many are betting it could blaze past $20–$25 in no time,” as posted by Altcoinpedia. Altcoinpedia @altcoinpediax · Follow $NMR – Numerai is absolutely LIT right now, shooting skyward after the JPMorgan bombshell. Thanks to the $500M backing, it’s already rocketed over 82%, and many on the street are betting it could blaze past $20–$25 in no time. Loading some on dips! 5:16 AM · Aug 27, 2025 32 Reply Copy link Read 6 replies NMR volumes rise as Numerai scales operations The token’s surge was accompanied by a rapid increase in market activity, with 24-hour trading volumes approaching $500 million. As of the latest update, NMR is trading at $16.10 and is up by 98.02% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Numerai has also strengthened its community ties by repurchasing $1 million worth of NMR and supporting staking incentives. At present, more than $7 million worth of tokens are staked by data scientists contributing trading signals. Recent hires have further signalled the company’s expansion. Numerai brought on a former Meta AI researcher and a trading engineer from quant fund Voleon, underscoring its commitment to scaling its machine learning strategies. Numerai Council of Elders @NumeraiCoE · Follow 3rd leg up. Crossed through $14 On top of the news today, @numerai also announced in the latest blog they hired an AI researcher formerly at Meta, a trading engineer formerly at Voleon, and several others Last month they also repurchased $1M in $NMR The news keeps flowing 5:16 AM · Aug 27, 2025 22 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply The company has made clear it is open to new approaches, including transformers and large language models, rather than relying on a single methodology. Hedge fund performance drives investor confidence Beyond the partnership with JPMorgan, Numerai’s track record has strengthened investor confidence in both its hedge fund and its blockchain-linked ecosystem. The 25.45% return in 2024 outpaced many established quant funds, positioning Numerai as a rising player in the space. This performance is critical at a time when AI-linked cryptocurrencies have faced mixed fortunes. While Numerai has gained on concrete institutional backing, other tokens have struggled. Recently, Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, citing billions in damages and raising governance concerns across the AI sector. This contrast has drawn attention to Numerai’s ability to secure institutional validation while delivering consistent performance. Numerai at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and finance The company’s model combines traditional hedge fund strategies with blockchain incentives for contributors. This hybrid approach has created one of the few AI-driven funds to gain traction with large-scale institutions. The JPMorgan partnership is seen as a potential turning point in Numerai’s trajectory, opening doors to larger capital inflows and broader adoption of its decentralised data science model. Momentum remains strong in both the fund’s growth and the token’s activity, as investors continue to monitor whether NMR can hold its gains. With institutional capital, active staking, and market excitement driving it forward, Numerai’s experiment in crowdsourced AI finance has reached one of its most critical phases to date.

        "BODY": "Key Takeaways: Kanye West posted a disclaimer on X disowning the first YZY token, claiming his Instagram was hacked. The original token’s deployer offloaded large amounts before the crash, causing over $24 million in lost liquidity. Legal accountability for celebrity crypto promotions is murky when endorsements occur without formal declarations or disclosures. Kanye West has denied involvement in a recently launched YZY-themed memecoin that surged and crashed earlier this month, stating his Instagram account was compromised. The claim was posted on West’s X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 26, in which he wrote: “My Instagram has been hacked and it’s following a fake coin…The official project is @YZY_MNY.” He went on to promote a different project, accompanied by a new Solana wallet address. Kanye West Claims Instagram Account ‘Hacked’ The first YZY token, which launched days earlier, had seen trading volumes spike before a major sell-off drained over $24 million in liquidity. Blockchain data from platforms like Birdeye and DEX Screener showed that wallet addresses connected to the deployer offloaded large portions of the supply shortly after launch. West’s new post suggests that the earlier coin was unauthorized, and that he is only endorsing the one tied to the updated address and Instagram handle. No further details were provided on how the alleged compromise occurred or who may have been behind the original launch. Meta, the parent company of Instagram, has not issued a public comment on the claim. A few influencers and promoters had pushed the earlier YZY token across social media in the days before and after the initial trading frenzy. Some have since deleted their posts.The original token is currently trading at near $0. West’s team has not released a formal statement beyond the X post. Community Express Distrust The community has demonstrated a level of disbelief in the statement. Autism Capital posted on X following Ye’s clarification, saying, “Kanye West claims his IG was ‘hacked’ and was promoting a fake coin several days AFTER all the dumping was done of his original coin. He then advertised a NEW coin saying ‘this is the real coin.’” Kanye West claims his IG was “hacked” and was promoting a fake coin several days AFTER all the dumping was done of his original coin. He then advertised a NEW coin saying “this is the real coin.” Haven’t we seen this playbook before? The grifting never ends. pic.twitter.com/XmNPIPJnpK — Autism Capital (@AutismCapital) August 26, 2025 “Haven’t we seen this playbook before? The grifting never ends,” they said. The situation adds to a growing number of celebrity-linked crypto controversies in 2024 and 2025, raising ongoing questions about how memecoins are launched, endorsed, and sold across platforms with limited oversight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could Kanye West be held legally responsible for the initial token? It depends on evidence of consent or participation. If the promotion occurred through his verified account, civil claims could still arise. How are celebrity memecoins typically launched? Often through coordination with promoters or influencers. Sometimes the celebrity is directly involved, other times not. What precautions can the public take before buying celebrity tokens? Verify wallet links through official press releases or company filings. Social media alone is not a reliable confirmation method.

        "BODY": "BlackRock’s Bitcoin stash has shrunk by more than $5 billion in just one week, with blockchain data showing steady outflows from the world’s largest asset manager’s ETF addresses. As of August 20, 2025, BlackRock held 749,940 BTC worth $87.22 billion. By August 27, those holdings had dropped to 744,590 BTC valued at $81.74 billion. The decline reveals both a 5,360 BTC reduction in balances and a 6.28% drop in price, with Bitcoin sliding $6,522 over the same period. BlackRock Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham According to Arkham, transfers are occurring in a steady pattern of 300 BTC tranches (around $33.5 million each), moved from the IBIT Bitcoin ETF wallet cluster (starting with bc1qw …) to other addresses. More than a dozen such transactions were recorded in the past 12 hours alone, raising speculation about ETF redemptions or internal fund rebalancing. Bitcoin falls 5% in a week The moves coincide with broader market weakness. Bitcoin has fallen 5.61% in the past week, underperforming Ethereum and most large-cap altcoins, as traders digest profit-taking flows and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s next policy shift. Despite the drawdown, BlackRock remains by far the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, with over $81.7 billion in BTC on its books, dwarfing holdings from competitors like Fidelity and Ark Invest. But the scale and regularity of the recent transfers has drawn market attention, with analysts warning that persistent ETF outflows could pressure prices further if sustained. For now, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF continues to lead in assets under management, but on-chain data suggests that the institutional rotation out of Bitcoin, and into Ethereum may be gathering pace. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether BlackRock’s latest Bitcoin shuffle is a short-term liquidity adjustment or the start of a deeper reallocation.

        "SOURCE_ID": 13,
        "BODY": "If you thought meme coins were just funny internet money, what better proof of their legitimacy than reputable investment firms now looking to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on them? The latest? Canary Capital has filed an application with the SEC seeking approval for a TRUMP Coin ETF . It’s worth noting that this is the third ETF filing for $TRUMP, and the first under the Securities Act of 1933. The other two filings came under the Investment Company Act of 1940, by Tuttle Capital and REX Shares-Osprey Funds. However, the SEC is yet to approve any of them. Read on as we unpack the effect this could have on the broader meme coin market, which will now undoubtedly attract even more attention from big-money players. The best part? We’ll also show you the best meme coins to buy now to ride this newfound legitimacy wave. $TRUMP – The Meme Coin That Started It All If you’ve been in the meme coin markets for even just a few months, you’ll definitely remember $TRUMP. Launched on January 18 this year, $TRUMP is Donald Trump’s official cryptocurrency, giving crypto enthusiasts an unofficial way to showcase their support (or disapproval – as we’ve seen with the tariff wars) for the current U.S. President. The token made headlines when it rocketed past $75 within just a couple of days of launch, fueled largely by Trump’s popularity, and, in particular, the brand-new pro-crypto stance he brought into government. $TRUMP Price Reacts to ETF News Following the ETF news, $TRUMP’s price jumped 2%, while open interest in TRUMP futures rose by 3% , signaling growing buying appetite. Although the token is still trading below key moving averages (50 EMA and 200 EMA), the RSI holds steady at 42, suggesting a potential buying zone. However, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analyst, notes that there’s only a slim chance the SEC will approve the $TRUMP ETF anytime soon . Why? Because current rules require an asset to be listed on the futures market for at least six months before ETF approval – and $TRUMP doesn’t yet meet that criteria. Plus, unlike ETFs tied to assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, $TRUMP is a pure meme coin driven almost entirely by the President’s popularity, so the SEC may view it as a risky bet. Still, the broader crypto market has thrived under Trump, thanks to his pro-crypto regulations and reserve policies. And as his popularity grows alongside the crypto markets, it’s the $TRUMP token that stands to benefit most. If you want to capitalize on this building bullish momentum, here are three altcoins that could be the next to explode in this booming market. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – The Ultimate Hype-Driven Degen Meme Coin for 1000x Returns Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is easily the wildest meme coin gearing up for its exchange debut. It’s based on Dogecoin, who, interestingly enough, is Maxi’s cousin and long-time nemesis. Growing up, Dogecoin hogged all the spotlight, while $MAXI sat sulking in the corner. Not anymore. Maxi hit the gym, lifted heavy, downed protein shakes and caffeine, and is back as Doge’s ultimate nightmare. With big green candle energy, $MAXI brings pure degen hype to the crypto markets. It’s made for those who roll their eyes at Doge’s ‘cutesy’ persona – because let’s face it: life-changing gains don’t come from being meek, but from ‘never missing leg day, never missing a pump.’ But the real question is: how does $MAXI become the next 1000x crypto ? The project has reserved a massive 40% of its total token supply for marketing, including paid ads, social media collabs, weekly contests, and leaderboard prizes. This aggressive push will not only build a loyal investor community rallying behind $MAXI, but also spread its quirky gym-bro humor across the entire crypto landscape. And the best part? $MAXI doesn’t plan to stop at a simple CEX or DEX listing. It’s also aiming for a futures listing, giving day traders the chance to hit the leverage pedal and supercharge their gains. Currently in presale, Maxi Doge has already pulled in over $1.6M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.000254. Visit $MAXI’s official website for more information. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram-Based Trading Bot for Limitless Daily Sniping Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the native cryptocurrency powering Snorter Bot – an upcoming Telegram bot designed to simplify meme coin trading for everyday investors. The bot’s lightning-fast sniping capabilities are a game-changer. Until now, most liquidity in hot meme coins was scooped up by whales using complex algorithms. But with Snorter Bot, you can place buy/sell limit and stop orders directly inside Telegram. The result? As soon as liquidity opens up, your transaction is executed. This puts you on equal footing with large players armed with sophisticated trading tools. On top of that, Snorter offers a clean, one-snapshot dashboard that lets you view all your crypto holdings in one place. No need to juggle multiple apps. As the meme coin mania grows, the demand for a unified solution that not only manages portfolios but also positions traders to catch those initial liquidity pumps is sky-high. That’s exactly what Snorter delivers. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token could hit $0.94 by year-end – representing a mouth-watering 817% gain from current levels. And buying $SNORT comes with exclusive perks, including: No daily sniping limits Reduced transaction fees of just 0.85% (vs. 1.5% for non-holders) Advanced analytics for better trading decisions Staking rewards, currently yielding 129% The $SNORT presale is live right now, with already over $3.4M in its early funding kitty. Each token is currently available for just $0.1025. For more information, check our $SNORT’s official website. 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Viral Art-Based Meme Coin Still Going Strong Comedian ($BAN) is no stranger to wild gains. Launched in October 2024, this hype-fueled token has already delivered early investors over 134,000% in gains – and that’s after falling almost 80% from its all-time highs. With a full-blown meme coin cycle now underway, $BAN is well-positioned to emerge as one of the top trending cryptos . The biggest argument for its massive upside potential lies in its price chart. $BAN is now tantalizingly close to breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. With EMAs pointing upward and momentum on its side (it’s up nearly 20% in the past week), $BAN looks set to surge past this resistance, potentially charging toward new all-time highs. But what is Comedian, really? It’s a sarcastic take on a super-controversial artwork – the infamous piece featuring a banana taped to a wall. No matter which side of the ‘is modern art profound or just plain dumb?’ debate you’re on, one thing’s for certain: the controversy fuels hype, and that traction is exactly what helps $BAN thrive. Wrapping Up A fresh ETF application for a mainstream meme coin like $TRUMP could be just the spark needed to ignite the already-brewing meme coin boom. Don’t want to miss out? Stack your crypto portfolio with promising new tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and Comedian ($BAN). That said, please keep in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky. None of the above is financial advice either, and you must always do your own research before investing.",

        "BODY": "Solana price prediction chatter often centers around breaking the $200 barrier, but what’s moving the needle today is adoption, not hype. As talk around Solana’s potential uptick continues, many SOL holders are quietly shifting focus to a newcomer, Remittix , rooted in utility. This emerging altcoin is more than a token, it’s a tool built for real payments, and adoption is soaring. Its practical approach is catching the attention of investors looking past token price spec to real infrastructure. Solana Price Prediction: Momentum Slows, Some Holders Pivot to Real Use Solana’s price has stabilized near $187, with some technical models still eyeing a rally to $220–$250 if strength holds above $185. However, bearish undertones are emerging and analysts suggest the token could dip toward $150 if downward momentum builds. Others are quite positive and have said that current levels provide a buy the dip opportunity at $176 or the breakout at $207. The Solana price prediction target is at $300 . With speculative narratives and memecoin fatigue mounting, Solana price prediction appears more fragile than outrightly bullish. Remittix: The Altcoin Gaining Real Traction Among Solana Holders Remittix (RTX) is winning attention as a practical solution in the PayFi space. SOL holders are moving capital into it as it continues raising funds, hitting over $21 million, and locks in adoption with its upcoming Q3 beta wallet and BitMart listing. What Makes Remittix Stand Out Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Security First: Audited by CertiK This project bridges crypto and everyday finance by enabling instant, low-fee transfers across 30+ countries, with support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. Its bit of execution-first design is what is drawing investors away from speculation-heavy tokens like SOL. Solana’s network has seen massive activity, with 100 million daily transactions, but price gains are plateauing. Whales are reallocating: SOL holders shifting into Remittix reflects a preference for new altcoin to watch that offers more than speed or staking. Solana Strength Isn’t Enough: Remittix Wins on Real Use Those holding SOL and hoping for a price breakout may need to shift perspective. While Solana price prediction may still point to upside, Remittix’s growing adoption, tooling, whale interest, and upcoming wallet ecosystem offer a clearer, action-driven path forward. If you’re weighing the best crypto to buy now, seeking crypto with real utility, or exploring an upcoming crypto project poised to deliver, buying RTX might be the strategic move that combines practicality with long-term growth.

        "BODY": "With cryptocurrency markets preparing for September 2025’s rollercoaster, one name that is building steam under the radar is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is available at $0.035 during presale phase 6. It will be 14.29% more expensive at $0.04 during phase 7. Early adopters who have already invested will be able to get a minimum of 200% return after MUTM is launched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised more than $15 million and has more than 15700 investors already onboard. Dogecoin (DOGE) still exhibits flat market dynamics, holding on to most of its earlier levels. Analysts now consider whether Mutuum Finance’s growing ecosystem and upgraded protocol could potentially make it a viable option for investors seeking to access the next level of decentralized finance opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE) Market Performance Update Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.2333, having fallen 1.04% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has ranged between $0.2273 and $0.2445 for the day. Despite being a top cryptocurrency, Dogecoin also faces downside risks. Analysts caution that if support levels of around $0.215 to $0.221 are breached, the price can drop another 25% or so. Conversely, technical indicators suggest that a breakout above recent resistance levels could pave the way for a rally, with estimates of the price increasing to as high as $0.37. Dogecoin remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, but its movement is subject to market forces and investor sentiment.

        "BODY": "MetaMask, one of the oldest crypto wallets in the industry, continues to add new features to outpace its competitors. At this point, Metamask finally allowed users to create wallets using their Google or Apple accounts. The new feature allows MetaMask users to create, backup, and restore wallets via their Google or Apple accounts. With the new “Social login” feature, millions of people can more easily open a cryptocurrency wallet and the number of cryptocurrency users can increase significantly. “Social login simplifies the wallet creation and management process by allowing users to log in with their social media accounts and create a password.” During the wallet creation process, keywords are generated in the background. Users can choose these keywords if they wish. In addition to keywords, users will choose their own password and use it when logging in with their social media accounts. While the latest feature makes opening a wallet easier, Metamask said the responsibility still remains with users, as if users lost their keywords, accessing the wallet would become impossible. At this point, MetaMask warned that if users lose their passwords, their wallets cannot be recovered and that they remain responsible. MetaMask previously announced that it is preparing to expand support for the Bitcoin and Solana networks and eventually remove gas fees as part of an update to its 2025 update roadmap. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "I dati on-chain e le voci di mercato mostrano che Bitcoin potrebbe essere entrato in una fase diversa . Glassnode ha avvertito il 20 agosto che il recente profit taking e la maggiore pressione di vendita indicano una fase avanzata del ciclo. Trader e analisti stanno osservando attentamente. Tre cicli principali, non solo gli halving Secondo l’analista James Checkmate , la storia di Bitcoin si inserisce in tre cicli principali , piuttosto che seguire un ritmo basato esclusivamente sugli halving. Ciclo di adozione: dal 2011 al 2018 Ciclo di adolescenza: dal 2018 al 2022 Ciclo di maturità: dal 2022 in poi Checkmate sostiene che queste fasi siano state guidate dai cambiamenti nei modelli di adozione e nella struttura del mercato , non dai tagli periodici alle ricompense dei blocchi.Ha persino definito Bitcoin come “l’unico asset endgame insieme all’oro” , suggerendo che l’attuale fase potrebbe durare più a lungo di quanto molti si aspettino. In my opinion, Bitcoin has experienced three cycles, and they are not anchored around the halvings. They are anchored around the trends in adoption and market structure, with the 2017 top, and 2022 bottom being the transition points Retail early adoption Wild West, Boom &… pic.twitter.com/3rbUUpnwen — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) August 26, 2025 Il modello dell’halving resta rilevante Nonostante ciò, la teoria dell’ halving rimane popolare. I mercati, storicamente, hanno raggiunto i massimi nell’anno successivo agli halving: esempi tipici sono il 2013, 2017 e 2021. Secondo questa narrazione, lo shock di offerta dovuto alla riduzione delle ricompense dei blocchi, combinato con la domanda, spinge i prezzi al rialzo. Secondo alcuni osservatori, questo schema sembra confermato anche per il 2025. Questo modello semplice continua ad essere usato perché è facile da prevedere e da modellare, motivo per cui molti trader vi si affidano ancora. Flussi istituzionali e liquidità contano più del calendario Alcuni esperti ritengono ora più importante osservare la liquidità e i flussi istituzionali rispetto agli eventi basati sul calendario. Il ciclo non è ufficialmente terminato fino a quando il mercato non vedrà rendimenti positivi il prossimo anno . La dinamica del ciclo quadriennale potrebbe essere conclusa. $BTC long-term holders have already realized more profit this cycle than in all but one prior cycle (2016–17), highlighting elevated sell-side pressure. Taken alongside other signals, this suggests the market has entered a late phase of the cycle. pic.twitter.com/PHXkOizXhz — glassnode (@glassnode) August 26, 2025 I veterani del mercato spiegano che i cicli spiegano meglio i picchi e i cali rispetto alle date di halving. In pratica: le persone comprano, i prezzi salgono, i venditori incassano i profitti e poi il ciclo ricomincia. La durata della fase rialzista dipende dalla quantità di liquidità disponibile e da quanto nuovo capitale entra nel mercato. Nel frattempo, il segnale di fase avanzata di Glassnode è un avvertimento, reso pubblico il 20 agosto . I trader che seguono i dati on-chain segnalano come aumento delle vendite e riduzione dell’accumulo siano indicatori per ridurre i rischi . Allo stesso tempo, i sostenitori del modello legato agli halving sottolineano lo schema storico: i picchi rialzisti si sono verificati dopo ogni halving in diversi cicli. Entrambe le scuole di pensiero si basano su date e numeri concreti — anni come 2011, 2013, 2017, 2021, 2022, 2025 e 2026 — per supportare le proprie analisi.",

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: Ava Labs Unveils Horizon for Secure RWA-Backed Loans A groundbreaking development is reshaping the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Ava Labs, the innovative developer behind the high-performance Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, has officially unveiled Horizon. This cutting-edge platform introduces a novel approach to lending, providing stablecoin loans that are securely collateralized by tokenized real-world assets (RWA) . This move, as reported by The Block, marks a significant step towards bridging the gap between conventional financial instruments and the efficiency of blockchain technology, especially in the realm of RWA-backed loans . What Exactly Are RWA-Backed Loans and Why Do They Matter? Understanding RWA-backed loans begins with grasping what real-world assets are and how they integrate with blockchain. Simply put, RWAs are tangible or intangible assets that exist in the traditional financial world—think real estate, commodities, or even government bonds. Tokenization transforms these assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, making them programmable, divisible, and easily transferable. Horizon leverages this concept by allowing institutional borrowers to obtain stablecoin loans, such as USDC, RLUSD, and GHO. These loans are not backed by volatile cryptocurrencies, but by the stability of tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds. This mechanism introduces a new layer of security and predictability to the DeFi lending landscape, making RWA-backed loans an attractive option for sophisticated investors. How Does Ava Labs’ Horizon Platform Function for RWA-Backed Loans? Ava Labs designed Horizon specifically for institutional players, ensuring a robust and compliant environment. The platform’s operational flow is straightforward yet powerful: Collateralization: Institutional borrowers deposit tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral. These digital representations of traditional assets are held securely on the blockchain. Stablecoin Issuance: In return, Horizon issues leading stablecoins like USDC, RLUSD, and GHO. These stablecoins provide immediate liquidity to the borrowers. Institutional Focus: The platform caters exclusively to institutions, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards and managing larger transaction volumes effectively. This streamlined process facilitates efficient capital deployment and access to liquidity, all while maintaining the integrity of underlying real-world assets. The innovation here lies in the seamless integration of traditional financial stability with blockchain’s inherent advantages, driving the utility of RWA-backed loans . What Are the Key Benefits of Embracing RWA-Backed Loans? The introduction of platforms like Horizon brings several compelling advantages to the financial ecosystem. These benefits extend beyond just the borrowers and lenders, potentially reshaping broader market dynamics: Enhanced Stability: By collateralizing loans with stable, regulated assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, Horizon significantly reduces the volatility often associated with crypto lending. This stability makes RWA-backed loans more appealing to risk-averse institutions. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization unlocks illiquid assets, allowing them to be used as collateral for immediate access to stablecoin liquidity. This can free up capital that would otherwise be tied up. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology provides unparalleled transparency for collateral management and loan terms. Smart contracts automate processes, reducing manual errors and increasing transactional efficiency. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Horizon acts as a crucial bridge, enabling traditional financial institutions to participate in the DeFi space with familiar asset classes, fostering broader adoption and innovation in RWA-backed loans . Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for RWA-Backed Loans While the potential of RWA-backed loans is immense, their widespread adoption also presents certain challenges and exciting opportunities. Understanding these aspects is vital for assessing the long-term impact of platforms like Horizon. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The evolving regulatory landscape for tokenized securities and DeFi remains a significant hurdle. Clear guidelines are essential for institutional confidence and scalability. Legal Frameworks: Ensuring the legal enforceability of tokenized asset ownership and collateral in various jurisdictions requires robust legal frameworks. Oracles and Data Integrity: Reliable and secure oracles are necessary to bring accurate, real-time data from the real world onto the blockchain, especially for asset valuation and liquidation processes. Exciting Opportunities: New Financial Products: Horizon paves the way for a new generation of financial products that blend the best of traditional finance with blockchain’s innovation. Broader Institutional Adoption: As more traditional assets are tokenized, more institutions will likely enter the DeFi space, driving massive growth. Global Accessibility: Tokenized RWAs can make traditionally exclusive assets accessible to a wider global audience, democratizing investment opportunities. Ava Labs’ Horizon is not just a platform; it represents a significant leap forward in integrating the stability of traditional assets with the innovation of decentralized finance. By offering secure RWA-backed loans to institutional borrowers, Horizon is setting a new standard for how value is exchanged and leveraged in the digital economy. This pioneering effort by Ava Labs and Avalanche is poised to unlock vast new markets and redefine the future of lending, making finance more efficient, transparent, and accessible for a global audience.

        "SUBTITLE": null,
        "AUTHORS": "Nellius Irene",

        "SOURCE_ID": 43,
        "BODY": "Alibaba will highlight its artificial intelligence strategy in its latest quarterly results, but analysts say the company still struggles to turn years of spending into real profits. Alibaba and rivals Tencent and Baidu have spent billions building large language models and adding AI to their platforms since ChatGPT’s success. However, Chinese consumers avoid paid AI services, making it hard for these firms to earn quick returns despite heavy spending. Alibaba targets business clients after weak consumer demand Over the past year, Alibaba has made huge investments in AI with upgrades and demonstrations, such as integrating its Qwen-Long model directly into its cloud platform. These efforts show how determined the company is to stay ahead of rivals like Tencent and Baidu, and prove to investors that it can produce visible results from years of spending. But despite its frequent product launches and marketing campaigns, Chinese consumers aren’t as willing to pay for AI subscriptions as customers in Western markets. For this reason, Alibaba and its competitors have begun selling AI through cloud-based application programming interface (API) services to enterprise customers. The plan is to encourage large companies to adopt these tools at scale to recover the revenue the consumer market has failed to deliver. Moving to enterprise clients doesn’t solve all of Alibaba’s problems; instead, it has created new challenges that could be just as difficult to manage. The industry’s biggest issue is intense competition because companies undercut each other to attract corporate customers. The problem with this approach is that the competing companies would sacrifice the margins they need to convince investors that their investments weren’t in vain. For example, Alibaba slashed prices on its Qwen-Long model’s API by a huge 97% and started charging 0.0005 yuan for every thousand tokens processed. ByteDance followed suit a month later and lowered the cost of its Doubao model by 63% to make it 2.6 yuan per million tokens. Analysts say these sharp discounts may attract customers searching for affordable AI solutions in the short term. Still, the companies will struggle to generate enough profits in the near future. Alibaba also has to worry about the increasing number of open-source AI models in China. Developers like DeepSeek released their models freely to the public to give other businesses, researchers, and startups access to advanced AI without licensing fees. This open-source approach may spread AI adoption across the economy, but it also largely reduces the incentives for enterprises to purchase similar products with a price tag. Price cuts and tough competition slow down Alibaba’s growth Alibaba’s cloud business is the main host for its AI services, and in the April–June quarter, it reported a revenue of 31.4 billion yuan ($4.4 billion). Data compiled by LSEG estimates this is about a 4.3% increase from the previous quarter and an 18% rise compared with the same period a year earlier. The numbers may seem healthy at first, but compared to Alibaba’s past performance, where the company delivered faster growth in its cloud performance, they’re less impressive. Analysts also say that even though the company is expanding, its pace is extremely slow due to the high competition as it tries to recover strong financial returns for its large AI investments. Alibaba’s e-commerce segment, which still makes up the largest overall revenue, also struggles in the face of China’s economic weakness and aggressive competition. Tight household budgets in the country have caused consumers to be cautious of their spending. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter. It's free .",

        "BODY": "The crypto market is undergoing some noticeable changes, with more and more investors turning their attention beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) to a wide variety of altcoins, each offering unique utility. Indeed, Bitcoin’s market dominance has slipped by around 13% since May, reflecting a shift in investor appetite. As leading institutional holders and retail investors alike seek higher returns and do their best to diversify by exploring alternative assets , the future of all cryptocurrencies is highly speculative. To see what assets might be best positioned to grow in the following weeks, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT-5 chatbot regarding 3 altcoins set to explode in September. Ethereum The language learning model’s (LLM) first pick was Ethereum ( ETH ), which remains the backbone of decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and Layer-2 ( L2 ) scaling. Ethereum prediction. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Moreover, with Bitcoin dominance cooling, we are starting to see evidence of institutional capital rotation into ETH as the “blue-chip altcoin.” For instance, data indicates that BlackRock alone poured $314.9 million into its Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on August 25, one of the biggest single-day inflows in history. Looking ahead, ChatGPT anticipates further L2 adoption and increases in staking yield demand, another of Ethereum’s main uses. Solana Solana ( SOL ) has also been on a resurgence, prompting the artificial intelligence ( AI ) to list it as its second pick. Solana prediction. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT With quick throughput, Solana is quickly becoming a hub for DeFi and, more importantly, meme coins. ChatGPT expects new DeFi protocols, non-fungible token ( NFT ) projects, and integrations to provide additional liquidity, potentially igniting a vertical rally. It is also worth noting that the European Central Bank (ECB) is now considering issuing the digital euro currency on Solana, which could contribute to its momentum. MAGACOIN Unlike ETH and SOL, the third pick, MAGACOIN (MAGAX) is a speculative presale meme coin with a lot of hype surrounding it, which could result in some short-term rallies. MAGACOIN prediction. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Adding to the bullish outlook are transparency and clearly defined tokenomics. Namely, the project completed a full audit with Hashex and is currently undergoing a review with CertiK, a leading blockchain security platform. What’s more, the meme coin has no VC dumping and comes with clear vesting schedules and liquidity locks, all designed to reduce risk.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Mantra Token Buyback: Massive $25M Plan Unveiled to Boost OM Value Exciting news is buzzing across the crypto world! Mantra (OM), a prominent real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, recently announced a significant financial maneuver. The company plans a massive $25 million Mantra token buyback of its native OM token. This strategic move aims to bolster the token’s value and reinforce investor confidence, signaling a strong commitment to its ecosystem’s future. What Does This Mantra Token Buyback Mean for OM? A token buyback, like the one Mantra is undertaking, involves a company repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. This action effectively reduces the total supply of tokens available. For OM holders, a reduced supply can lead to increased scarcity, which often translates to higher demand and, consequently, a potential rise in the token’s price. Mantra’s decision to execute a Mantra token buyback of this scale highlights its belief in the long-term value of its project and its dedication to its community. This substantial investment by Mantra directly benefits the OM ecosystem. It demonstrates financial strength and a proactive approach to market management. Investors typically view buybacks as a positive indicator, suggesting that the company believes its token is undervalued. Why Are Token Buybacks Beneficial for Your Portfolio? Token buybacks offer several key advantages for both the project and its investors. Here’s a breakdown of the primary benefits: Price Appreciation: By reducing circulating supply, buybacks can create upward pressure on the token’s price. Increased Scarcity: Fewer tokens in circulation make each remaining token potentially more valuable. Investor Confidence: A buyback signals financial health and a commitment to delivering value to token holders. Reduced Volatility: Strategic buybacks can help stabilize token prices during market fluctuations. Long-Term Growth: It aligns the interests of the project with those of its investors, fostering a strong community. Mantra’s initiative underscores these points, making the Mantra token buyback a crucial event for the platform. Mantra’s Vision: Powering Real-World Asset Tokenization Mantra isn’t just another crypto project; it’s at the forefront of the burgeoning RWA tokenization sector. RWA tokenization involves converting tangible assets, like real estate, art, or commodities, into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process unlocks liquidity, increases transparency, and democratizes access to traditional investments. The platform’s focus on RWA tokenization positions it uniquely within the blockchain landscape. By leveraging blockchain technology, Mantra aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). This mission is ambitious and requires robust financial backing, which the Mantra token buyback further solidifies. What’s Next for OM Holders? Actionable Insights With this significant buyback underway, OM token holders might wonder about the immediate and long-term implications. While no investment is guaranteed, historical data often shows positive sentiment following such announcements. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reaction: Observe how the market responds to the buyback news and its execution. Understand the Fundamentals: Deepen your understanding of Mantra’s RWA tokenization roadmap and partnerships. Consider Long-Term Holdings: If you believe in Mantra’s vision, this buyback could be a positive signal for long-term holding strategies. The success of this Mantra token buyback will likely depend on various market factors and the platform’s continued development in the RWA space. Concluding Thoughts on Mantra’s Strategic Move Mantra’s announcement of a $25 million OM token buyback is a powerful statement of intent. It reflects the platform’s confidence in its RWA tokenization mission and its commitment to creating value for its community. This strategic financial decision has the potential to significantly impact the OM token’s market dynamics, fostering a stronger, more resilient ecosystem. As the RWA sector continues to expand, Mantra’s proactive approach positions it as a key player to watch. This buyback isn’t just about reducing supply; it’s about building a foundation for future growth and reinforcing trust among its stakeholders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a token buyback? A token buyback is when a project or company repurchases its own native tokens from the open market. This action reduces the total circulating supply of the token, often aiming to increase its value and demonstrate confidence in the project’s future. Q2: Why is Mantra conducting a $25 million Mantra token buyback? Mantra is undertaking this substantial buyback to enhance the value of its OM token by reducing supply, boost investor confidence, and signal its strong financial health and long-term commitment to the RWA tokenization ecosystem. Q3: How might this buyback affect OM token holders? For OM token holders, a successful buyback can lead to increased scarcity, which may drive up demand and potentially result in price appreciation. It also signifies a positive outlook from the project team, reinforcing confidence in their investment. Q4: What is RWA tokenization, and how does Mantra fit into it? RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization is the process of converting tangible assets like real estate or commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain. Mantra is a leading platform focused on this sector, aiming to make traditional assets more liquid, transparent, and accessible through blockchain technology. Q5: When will the Mantra token buyback take place? Mantra announced the $25 million buyback via X, indicating it is an ongoing or imminent process.

        "BODY": "Quick Highlights REX-Osprey BNB ETF may launch November 9–10, 2025. Offers direct BNB exposure with staking potential. Cash-only shares issuance and redemption. REX Shares and Osprey Funds File for Spot BNB ETF REX Shares and Osprey Funds have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register a spot BNB ETF. Both companies previously bypassed the standard procedure with their Solana (SOL) fund, streamlining the launch process. The product, named REX-Osprey BNB + Staking ETF, would trade on the Cboe BZX exchange if approved. The custodian and transfer agent have not yet been disclosed in the application. Direct Exposure to BNB and Staking Potential The fund aims to provide investors with direct exposure to BNB, the native token of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Most of the trust’s assets are expected to be used for staking through trusted intermediaries, offering a potential yield in addition to price appreciation. Shares will be issued and redeemed exclusively in cash, according to the fund’s structure. The application was filed on the evening of August 26, 2025. Launch Timeline and Regulatory Advantage Analyst James Seyffarth of Bloomberg Intelligence suggests the product could launch as early as November 9–10, 2025, thanks to a streamlined process. This is made possible by the fund’s classification under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing it to bypass the lengthy registration process required under the Securities Act of 1933, which applies to most spot cryptocurrency ETFs. REX Shares and Osprey Funds employed a similar strategy for their Solana ETF, filed in June 2025 and launched on July 2, 2025. That fund raised $161.7 million in its first two months, though this was below the performance of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Both companies have also applied for additional altcoin-focused funds.",

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Bitcoin $160K: Analyst Predicts Explosive Year-End Rally The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with an exciting new forecast! A prominent analyst suggests that Bitcoin could hit an astonishing $160,000 by the close of this year. This bold prediction has many investors and enthusiasts wondering about the potential for an explosive year-end rally for Bitcoin $160K . Who is Behind the Bitcoin $160K Prediction? The analyst making waves with this remarkable forecast is Timothy Peterson. Peterson, known for his data-driven insights into the crypto market, has provided a detailed rationale for his optimistic outlook. His analysis offers a compelling perspective on where the flagship cryptocurrency might be headed as 2024 draws to a close. Understanding his methodology is key to appreciating the potential for Bitcoin $160K . What Drives the $160,000 Target for BTC? Peterson’s prediction is not based on mere speculation. Instead, it draws heavily on historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s price movements. He highlights a significant trend: Historically, Bitcoin has shown a 70% probability of rising during the four months leading up to Christmas. During these periods, the average gain has been an impressive around 44% . This consistent seasonal strength forms the core of his argument for a substantial increase, potentially pushing Bitcoin towards the coveted $160K mark . However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and it is crucial to consider all factors. Are Past Trends a Reliable Indicator for Bitcoin $160K? While historical data provides valuable insights, every market cycle presents unique conditions. Peterson himself acknowledges this, pointing out specific years where Bitcoin’s performance deviated from the average trend. He specifically mentioned: 2017: A period of massive parabolic growth. 2018: A significant bear market correction. 2020: The onset of the global pandemic and subsequent economic shifts. 2022: A challenging year marked by macroeconomic headwinds and crypto-specific events. These examples remind us that while patterns exist, external economic conditions and market sentiment play a crucial role. Therefore, while a historical 70% probability is encouraging, it is wise to remain vigilant and informed about the current landscape as we consider the possibility of Bitcoin $160K . What Current Market Conditions Could Influence BTC’s Trajectory? Unlike the “exceptional periods” Peterson noted, the present market environment has its own set of unique dynamics. Key factors that could influence Bitcoin’s journey towards $160K include: Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened doors for significant institutional capital. Global Economic Outlook: Inflation trends, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical stability can all impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Evolving regulations worldwide can either foster growth or introduce new challenges. Bitcoin Halving Event: The recent halving has historically preceded bull runs, reducing the supply of new Bitcoin and potentially increasing its value. These elements, combined with general market sentiment, will collectively shape Bitcoin’s price action in the coming months. Staying updated on these developments is essential for anyone tracking the path to Bitcoin $160K . Navigating Potential Roadblocks to Bitcoin $160K While the prospect of Bitcoin reaching $160,000 is exciting, it is also important to consider potential challenges. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and several factors could hinder such a rapid ascent: Unexpected Macroeconomic Shocks: A sudden economic downturn or crisis could lead investors to de-risk. Regulatory Crackdowns: Stricter regulations in major economies could dampen enthusiasm. Market Manipulation: Large market players can influence prices, leading to unpredictable swings. Technical Issues or Security Breaches: Although rare, significant issues with exchanges or the network could erode trust. Therefore, a balanced perspective is vital. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making any financial decisions. Actionable Insights for the Aspiring Crypto Investor For those looking at the possibility of Bitcoin $160K , here are some practical considerations: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, analyst reports, and economic indicators. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across different assets. Understand Risk: Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Short-term fluctuations are common; a long-term view can help navigate volatility. These steps can help you make more informed decisions, regardless of whether Bitcoin reaches the predicted target. The prediction of Bitcoin $160K by year-end from Timothy Peterson injects a significant dose of optimism into the crypto space. While historical trends provide a compelling argument, the dynamic nature of the market means vigilance and informed decision-making are paramount. Whether Bitcoin reaches this astounding target or not, understanding the underlying factors and maintaining a strategic approach will be crucial for navigating the exciting journey ahead in the world of digital assets.

        "BODY": "Hut 8 (HUT) is set to spin out most of its bitcoin (BTC) mining operations into American Bitcoin (ABTC) within the next week, a move that Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said could re-rate the company’s shares. Yesterday, Hut 8 unveiled plans to develop 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity across four U.S. sites, in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, more than doubling its power under management to 2.55 GW. Palmer raised Hut 8's price target to $36 from $33 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The new price target suggests nearly 40% upside from yesterday's close just below $26. Palmer noted the update was significant because it showed a clear path to monetizing Hut 8’s energy pipeline, with the company already securing land and power agreements, building infrastructure and negotiating with potential customers. By separating its mining operations into ABTC, Hut 8 aims to position itself as an energy infrastructure pure-play, giving it better access to cheaper project financing by avoiding the volatility tied to bitcoin revenues, the analyst said. The company has up to $2.4 billion in liquidity to support the expansion, including $1.2 billion in bitcoin, $330 million in credit facilities and a $1 billion equity program, the report noted. Hut 8 is a flexible bet on both bitcoin and the artificial intelligence (AI)/high performance computing (HPC) boom, Palmer said.

        "BODY": "Bitcoin miner Hut 8 has announced plans to develop four new sites across the United States, adding 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of utility capacity to its platform. Key Takeaways: Hut 8 is developing four new U.S. sites, adding 1.53 GW of capacity. The expansion will more than double its managed capacity to 2.5 GW across 19 sites. Texas hosts the largest project, a 1,000 MW site under ERCOT. The projects, spanning Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois, will advance from “Capacity Under Exclusivity” into a newly introduced category called “Capacity Under Development.” Once commercialized, Hut 8 expects its platform to exceed 2.5 GW of capacity under management across 19 sites, more than doubling its current scale, according to a Tuesday press release . Texas Leads Hut 8 Expansion with 1,000 MW Site The four projects vary in size from 50 MW to 1,000 MW. The largest, located in Texas, falls under the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) with 1,000 MW of available utility capacity. A second Texas site adds 180 MW, while a Louisiana site under Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) contributes 300 MW. The final 50 MW site is in Illinois within the PJM Interconnection. Collectively, the 1,530 MW represents the first phase of a broader multi-gigawatt pipeline. Hut 8 said the sites were chosen for near-term power access and flexibility to support diverse customer requirements, including advanced data infrastructure and next-generation compute. Today, we announced plans to develop four new sites across the United States, advancing 1,530 MW in our pipeline from exclusivity into development. The sites are expected to diversify Hut 8's geographic footprint and position the company to meet growing demand from prospective… pic.twitter.com/ZSLhsxRAGA — Hut 8 (@Hut8Corp) August 26, 2025 To reflect its progress, Hut 8 has added “Capacity Under Development” to its project framework. This category applies to late-stage projects where land and power agreements are in place and design and buildout are underway. As of August 25, 2025, Hut 8 reported 10,620 MW across its pipeline: 6,815 MW under diligence, 1,255 MW under exclusivity, 1,530 MW under development, and 1,020 MW already commercialized. CEO Asher Genoot said the expansion is designed to strengthen the firm’s geographic footprint in regions of rising energy demand. “By advancing more than 1.5 gigawatts from exclusivity into development, we position ourselves to more than double the scale of our platform and address accelerating demand across energy-intensive use cases,” Genoot said. Hut 8 Outlines $2.4B Funding Strategy for Expansion Hut 8 plans to fund the projects with a mix of reserves, credit facilities, and equity flexibility. As of August 25, the company held $2.4 billion in liquidity, including $1.2 billion in Bitcoin reserves (10,278 BTC). It also has a new $200 million revolving credit facility with Two Prime and an expanded $130 million facility with Coinbase. In addition, Hut 8 launched a $1 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity program, replacing a prior program that was only partially used. As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today.

        "BODY": "Cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming a cornerstone for Venezuelans as they search for stability amid a collapsing national currency and mounting government restrictions. From neighborhood shops to large retailers, many businesses now accept digital assets through platforms like Binance and Airtm. Stablecoins such as USDt are even being used to pay employees, while universities have started offering courses on blockchain and crypto finance. “I can use it almost anywhere now,” said shopper Victor Sousa, after purchasing phone accessories with USDt. “The plan is to one day have my savings in crypto.” Crypto Adoption Surges Among Venezuelans According to the Chainalysis 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Venezuela ranked 13th worldwide, with usage rising 110% over the past year. The surge coincides with the sharp decline of the bolívar, which has lost more than 70% of its value since the government stopped supporting it in October. Inflation soared to 229% in May, according to the Venezuelan Finance Observatory. “Venezuelans started using cryptocurrencies out of necessity,” said economist Aarón Olmos, noting that people face shrinking wages, inflationary pressure, foreign currency shortages, and limited access to traditional banking. Still, challenges persist. US sanctions on Venezuela’s financial sector have led Binance and other platforms to restrict services tied to sanctioned banks and individuals. Internet connectivity issues also make consistent use difficult. Yet, experts say the system remains resilient, even as the government’s policy has been inconsistent. Venezuela’s own attempt at launching a state-backed digital currency, the petro , collapsed last year. Meanwhile, its main crypto regulator was dismantled in 2023 following corruption scandals linked to oil transactions. Remittances and Rising Tensions Cryptocurrencies are also becoming a vital tool for remittances. In 2023, nearly 9% of the $5.4 billion sent home by Venezuelans abroad—about $461 million—arrived via digital assets. Families prefer crypto over services like Western Union, which suffer from high fees and delays. At the same time, geopolitical tensions are escalating. Venezuela’s defense minister announced new naval and drone patrols in the Caribbean after Washington deployed an amphibious warship squadron, later reinforced with a missile cruiser and a nuclear-powered submarine. The Trump administration has also intensified its pursuit of President Nicolás Maduro, doubling the reward for his capture to $50 million, and offering $25 million for Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. For ordinary Venezuelans, however, the fight for economic survival remains closer to home—where digital assets are becoming a lifeline against the collapse of their national currency.

The post emphasized McDonald’s remarks that Ripple is placing a strong focus on stablecoins, while also underscoring the role of XRP as a global bridge asset . According to the tweet, Ripple sees this approach as the area where it can create the most substantial global impact. BREAKING: Jack McDonald says Ripple bets big on stablecoins, utilizing XRP as the global bridge because that’s where Ripple can have the biggest global impact. #XRP | #RLUSD | #Crypto pic.twitter.com/ljQAhTWMCR — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 26, 2025 McDonald on Stablecoins and Ripple’s Strategy In the video captioned in the tweet, McDonald discussed Ripple’s growing involvement in the stablecoin market and the company’s reasoning for prioritizing this sector. He explained that Ripple has already been running pilots across various regions and described these initiatives as quite successful. McDonald stated that Ripple firmly believes in a tokenized world where assets operate on-chain, but noted that the company’s resources are now being directed primarily toward stablecoins. He emphasized that Ripple views stablecoins as the key to unlocking future opportunities in digital finance and as the area where the company can make its greatest contribution. McDonald also commented on the state of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), particularly within the United States. He pointed out that U.S. legislation currently prevents the federal government from issuing a CBDC, which means that the growth of such digital currencies must be examined on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.

The Role of XRP During his remarks, McDonald also addressed the role of XRP in Ripple’s broader vision. He reaffirmed that Ripple intends to leverage XRP as a global bridge currency within its stablecoin framework. According to McDonald, the integration of XRP as a bridge is central to the company’s long-term plan to facilitate international transactions and interoperability in a tokenized economy. The focus on XRP as a connector between stablecoins aligns with Ripple’s long-standing positioning of the digital asset as a tool for cross-border value transfer. Ripple’s Approach The comments shared by Xaif Crypto provide insight into Ripple’s current priorities. By committing its resources to stablecoins, Ripple is signaling a clear intention to strengthen its influence in global financial infrastructure. At the same time, the company continues to emphasize XRP’s role as a bridge asset, ensuring that the digital token remains central to its ecosystem.

        "BODY": "Quick Highlights Christine Johnson to leave the CFTC on September 3, 2025 Johnson warns Congress: more resources needed for crypto oversight Acting Chair Caroline Pham pushes for new rules on prediction markets CFTC Commissioner Christine Johnson to Step Down Amid Crypto Push Democratic Commissioner Christine Johnson will leave the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on September 3, 2025, while Acting Chair Caroline Pham will continue to lead the agency, according to Bloomberg . Johnson’s Final Message: More Resources for Crypto Oversight In her farewell statement, Johnson urged Congress to strengthen the regulator’s capacity for digital asset oversight: “At a time when such significant changes to markets and market structure are being considered, I am concerned that the Commission’s expert staff receive the support and investment needed to succeed.” Johnson, who joined the CFTC in 2022 after being nominated by former U.S. President Joe Biden, has consistently advocated for expanding the agency’s authority over cryptocurrencies. Her departure comes as the CFTC faces major challenges, including a 15% reduction in staff since the start of current U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, with further cuts looming in the enforcement division. Pham Pushes for New Market Rules as Leadership Shifts Acting Chair Caroline Pham, appointed by Trump, has already criticized past CFTC policies on prediction markets, stating that legal uncertainty “requires a rethink of the rules and approaches, not a simple abandonment of the previous policy.” Reports suggest Pham has launched an expert roundtable to draft a new regulatory framework and is reviewing the agency’s stance on platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket. Notably, Kalshi recently won a case against the CFTC, signaling a possible shift in regulatory strategy. Leadership Uncertainty and Delays Meanwhile, Trump’s nominee for CFTC Chair, Brian Quintenza, is still awaiting Senate confirmation amid delays in committee votes. Despite the holdup, the White House has reaffirmed support for Quintenza, and leading crypto industry associations have sent a joint letter urging his approval. Former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, who stepped down in January, warned before leaving that comprehensive crypto regulations may take 6–10 months to adopt and another year to implement. This leadership reshuffle coincides with the agency’s Crypto Sprint initiative, which aims to create transparent rules for the crypto market in collaboration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",

        "BODY": "On-chain data and market chatter show Bitcoin may be shifting into a different phase. Glassnode warned on Aug. 20 that recent profit taking and higher selling pressure point to a late stage in the cycle. Traders and analysts are watching closely. Three Cycles Not Halvings According to analyst James Checkmate, Bitcoin’s history fits into three broad cycles rather than a rhythm set by halvings. He calls them an adoption cycle from 2011 to 2018, an adolescence cycle from 2018 to 2022, and a maturity cycle from 2022 onward. Checkmate argues these phases were driven by changing adoption patterns and market structure, not by the block reward cuts that happen every four years. He even said Bitcoin is “the only other endgame asset alongside gold,” suggesting the current phase could stretch longer than many expect. In my opinion, Bitcoin has experienced three cycles, and they are not anchored around the halvings. They are anchored around the trends in adoption and market structure, with the 2017 top, and 2022 bottom being the transition points Retail early adoption Wild West, Boom &… pic.twitter.com/3rbUUpnwen — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) August 26, 2025 Bitcoin Halving Pattern Still In Play Reports have disclosed that the halving theory remains popular because markets have peaked in the year after previous halvings — 2013, 2017, and 2021 are often pointed to as examples. The narrative goes that a supply shock from reduced block rewards , combined with demand, pushes prices higher, and observers say the pattern seems on track for 2025. That view keeps a simple timing model alive: halving, then peak the next year. It’s tidy and it’s easy to model, which is why many traders still use it. Institutional Flows And Liquidity Based on reports, some voices now put more weight on liquidity and institutional flows than on calendar-based events. Analysts say the cycle is not officially over until the market sees positive returns next year. The four-year cycle may be finished. They added that business cycle dynamics explain the peaks and troughs better than halving dates. Market veterans keep it practical: cycles never truly disappear — people buy, prices rise, then sellers clear the gains, and we start again. How long the bullish leg runs depends on where liquidity sits and how much new capital arrives. $BTC long-term holders have already realized more profit this cycle than in all but one prior cycle (2016–17), highlighting elevated sell-side pressure. Taken alongside other signals, this suggests the market has entered a late phase of the cycle. pic.twitter.com/PHXkOizXhz — glassnode (@glassnode) August 26, 2025 Bitcoin Signals And Stakes Meanwhile, Glassnode’s late-cycle signal is a warning , and it was made public on Aug. 20. Traders who follow on-chain metrics point to elevated selling and reduced accumulation as signs to tighten risk. At the same time, proponents of the halving-linked model note the historical pattern: bull peaks occurred after the halving in multiple cycles. Both sides use hard dates and numbers — years like 2011, 2013, 2017, 2021, 2022, 2025 and 2026 — to make their cases. Featured image from Equiti, chart from TradingView",

        "BODY": "Should holders worry about the Cardano bearish outlook? And what does the latest Hyperliquid technical analysis signal? Both projects have been flashing warning signs, with ADA struggling to defend its support levels and Hyperliquid moving within tight supply and demand zones. These developments matter because they show how fast the market can shift, where hesitation can erase gains in an instant, leaving even confident traders second-guessing positions and scrambling to protect profits when conditions change without warning. But while some names fight resistance and mounting sell pressure, one project is doing the opposite. BlockDAG has turned its presale into one of the most active events of 2025, pulling in massive funding and preparing for top-tier exchange listings. For those asking about the best crypto to invest in now, the split is becoming obvious: some projects are stuck in neutral, while others are accelerating toward real growth with BlockDAG clearly capturing stronger momentum and shaping itself as the frontrunner in this shifting market landscape. BlockDAG’s Road to $1: Scarcity Driving Urgency The BlockDAG presale has become the perfect example of how limited supply can create demand. Each batch sells out quickly, with the price rising step by step, forcing participants to act faster. So far, more than $385 million has been raised, and over 25.5 billion BDAG coins have been sold in 30 batches. Early buyers from batch 1 are already seeing paper returns of 2900%. This structure creates pressure on every new batch. As the entry price climbs, the incentive to join sooner grows stronger. That urgency is fueling the idea that BDAG could realistically reach $1 by 2027. For those joining now, the possibility of turning a small entry into one of the most talked-about runs of the decade is creating serious excitement, especially as more latecomers realize they must pay higher prices to secure their share. What makes the setup stronger is how this scarcity is carefully built. With a hard cap of $600M, BlockDAG is ensuring deep liquidity for exchange listings and ecosystem expansion. Confirmed listings on MEXC, LBank, and BitMart are already locked in, while discussions with Coinbase and Gemini suggest even wider exposure ahead, giving the presale more credibility and visibility worldwide. For anyone wondering about the best crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG’s presale is difficult to overlook. The limited supply system, rapid fundraising, and major exchange pipeline make it one of the most urgent opportunities in 2025, with every sign pointing toward accelerated growth. Cardano Bearish Outlook Adds More Pressure The Cardano bearish outlook has been intensifying after ADA failed to hold above $1.02 and dropped under support at $0.90. Current trading shows ADA moving around $0.91, down more than 6% during recent market moves. Technical analysis shows a narrow path for recovery, with a short-term rebound to $1.10 possible if support holds, but a break under $0.83 could open the door to deeper declines. Liquidations have added to the stress, with leveraged traders losing more than $118,000 as ADA dipped close to $0.85. This reinforces bearish pressure and raises questions about ADA’s ability to defend key levels. Technical indicators such as the MACD are flashing weakness, with analysts noting the risk of a bearish crossover. ADA has also decoupled from Bitcoin’s movement, facing resistance at $0.94 that continues to block upside attempts. Unless ADA finds strong momentum soon, the risk of sliding toward $0.80 grows higher, leaving holders nervous about near-term performance. Hyperliquid Technical Analysis: Short-Term Bearish, Long-Term Potential The latest Hyperliquid technical analysis shows weakness after price rejection near $50, with movement toward $40. In the short term, signals lean bearish. RSI and OBV indicators suggest selling strength, and the Supertrend points to a continuation of downward pressure. Analysts identify a demand zone around $39–$41 and a supply area at $47–$49. A push above $49 could trigger a move toward $55, but if support breaks, declines to $36 or even $32 are possible. Forecasts for the coming days remain cautious, with projections from CoinCodex hinting at a potential 20% dip to around $36.47. However, wedge patterns on broader charts suggest that if Hyperliquid can break resistance, price targets above $60 are achievable. This leaves Hyperliquid with a split outlook: short-term weakness but medium- to long-term possibilities if buying pressure returns. Takeaway The latest updates confirm how quickly crypto sentiment changes. The Cardano bearish outlook shows ADA struggling near $0.91, with risks of another drop if support fails. The Hyperliquid technical analysis highlights near-term weakness, with forecasts showing potential declines before any long-term breakout. BlockDAG, however, is setting a completely different tone. With $385 million raised, 25.5 billion coins sold, and strong exchange listings ahead, the presale is already one of the most active in 2025. Scarcity-driven mechanics are pushing urgency, while mobile mining adoption builds real usage from day one, adding layers of confidence rarely seen in early-stage crypto projects. For those who don’t want to watch opportunities slip by, BlockDAG is being seen as the best crypto to invest in now . With projections of $1 by 2027 and the momentum already visible, the chance to enter before the next batch increase may be one of the most defining moves of the year.
