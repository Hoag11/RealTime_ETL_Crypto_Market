        "BODY": "Thailand Police Uncover Crypto-to-Gold Laundering Scheme Authorities reported that wallets linked to Han processed more than $47 million in USDT between January and March 2024. The funds were then used to buy gold in at least 30 separate deals, each involving no less than 10 kilograms. Investigators from Thailand’s Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) suspect Han collaborated with overseas gold vendors to ship the precious metal to unidentified scam groups. His seized phone contained multiple crypto accounts and wallet records pointing to extensive laundering activities. Han admitted he studied in China before working for a South Korean company specializing in converting illicit crypto into commodities like gold. Scam Network Behind the Laundering Officials believe Han’s actions were tied to international scam call centers. Victims were first paid for simple online tasks but later lured into investing in fake crypto projects that promised returns of up to 50 percent. Eventually, their accounts were frozen, and withdrawals denied. The network had been operating since early 2024 and is linked to widespread fraud across several countries. Ten Arrests, More Expected Prior to Han’s arrest, Thai police detained ten suspects. Five were accused of laundering money, while others managed mule accounts used to collect funds from victims. TCSD commander Pol Maj Gen Athip Phongsiwapai confirmed that Han faces charges of fraud, impersonation, and money laundering. Authorities are analyzing new leads from devices seized during the arrest. Global Wave of Enforcement The Thai operation is part of a broader crackdown on crypto-related crime. In July, a Beijing court sentenced seven people over a $20 million laundering scheme linked to a former video platform employee. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities charged a Russian crypto entrepreneur in June for facilitating a $500 million laundering network.",

The Structure of the Product The Gemini XRP Mastercard is the product of a collaboration between Gemini, Ripple, WebBank, and Mastercard’s global network. Public filings and industry reporting confirm that the rollout is backed by $75 million in committed funds, ensuring sufficient support for both technical infrastructure and customer-facing incentives. The card is designed to allow users to hold XRP in their Gemini accounts and spend it anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Transactions are settled instantly with XRP-to-fiat conversion at the point of sale, making the process seamless for the cardholder. A key component of the card is its rewards program. Users can earn as much as four percent cashback in XRP on eligible purchases, while reports indicate that transaction fees will be kept as low as one percent in some cases. These incentives are structured to encourage adoption and demonstrate XRP’s utility beyond the exchange environment. By combining rewards with integrated settlement, the partners attempt to build a bridge between cryptocurrency and mainstream financial services. Strategic Significance The launch is strategically framed as more than just a new consumer product. Gemini and Ripple have positioned Mastercard as a vehicle to demonstrate XRP’s capacity for real-world use cases, particularly in areas where speed and low-cost transactions matter most. Emerging markets and travel-related corridors, including destinations such as Thailand, have been cited as early focus areas, where near-instant settlement and cost efficiency could bring immediate benefits. The collaboration also underscores the importance of regulatory compliance. By issuing the card through WebBank, a U.S.-chartered financial institution, the project aligns with established financial regulations and integrates into Mastercard’s existing infrastructure. This design not only helps to build institutional confidence but also supports scalability by ensuring that the card can be offered within established legal frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications In the weeks leading up to the launch, XRP’s price climbed above the $3 mark, reflecting renewed interest as both legal clarity and consumer utility began to converge. Analysts have suggested that Mastercard could act as a catalyst for further adoption, with some projections placing XRP’s potential range between $3.34 and $4 if the card secures significant user traction. The near-term focus, however, will be on actual performance metrics. Investors and users alike will be monitoring transaction volumes, the effectiveness of the rewards program, and the efficiency of instant conversion at scale. The launch day itself represents the first practical test of the product’s operational capabilities. Questions around onboarding simplicity, merchant acceptance, and customer engagement will determine whether the card achieves traction beyond its initial marketing push.

        "BODY": "Once an economic hub, Guangdong now shows the strain of China’s shifting economy, with shut-down factories and quiet streets reflecting a wider slowdown across the southern export hub. The United States and China remain locked in drawn-out trade talks. Washington has cut the extra tariffs on goods from China to 30% while negotiations continue. With exports of almost $821 billion in the previous year, Guangdong remains exposed to the effects of higher tariffs. The recent numbers show reduced economic activity Guangdong expanded by only 3.5% in the previous year and missed the target for a third year and falling below the 5% national rate. Shenzhen remains the tech hub of China and maintains its status as one of the richest cities in the country, and topped national average last year. Guangzhou, the province’s capital, grew by only 2.1%. While the neighbor Foshan, a center for furniture and home appliances, rose 1.3%. Shantou, a special economic zone, grew by only 0.02%. Guangdong’s trade history dates back a few centuries. It was among the few cities in China that opened trade for foreign merchants. In 1957, after the first Canton Fair, Guangdong became the main channel for much of the nation’s overseas trade. The province’s GDP per capita rose over 220-fold between 1978 – 2018, and the provincial economy today is larger than South Korea. However, even before Trump took office again, the move of low-cost production to cheaper hubs was already slowing growth. Property prices have recovered slowly in the province as compared with other wealthy regions. Guangdong also hosts some of China’s best-known developers, such as Kaisa, Evergrande Country Garden, and Vanke. Analysts suggest that the housing market has weighed on both shoppers and companies, with retail and other gauges trailing national averages. Because Guangdong sends more tax to the central government than other provinces, the slowdown carries national consequences. In recent years, a broader downturn has led Beijing to redirect a larger share of that revenue to support growth in other poorer regions. Even tech exporters are diversifying Guangdong-based BYD, the electric-vehicle maker, is also looking to expand production overseas, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan . Trump’s cancellation of “de minimis” tax exemptions for smaller parcels would hit Guangdong especially hard, since many Temu and Shein suppliers are based there. Few places show the loss of momentum more clearly than Ronggui. Ronggui was the first such hub to record total industrial output above Rmb100 billion, and Deng Xiaoping once praised the area. But growth tied to refrigerators and air conditioners has stalled as margins for mid-range goods narrow and higher-tech sectors take root elsewhere. Nearby Foshan’s growth has also dropped. The cooling is felt on the street. “I’m just about able to make my living,” said Zhou Jingjing, who sells dumplings near an industrial area, noting that fewer factories now ask staff to stay for overtime, cutting demand for evening snacks. Liang, a metal worker at a refrigerator plant in Ronggui, said his monthly pay fell to approximately Rmb7,000 – Rmb9,000 over the past 2 years as demand during the covid-era reduced. He still believes the job is steady, but his apartment has lost value in the nationwide property slump. “I have a mortgage here and my kids are in school,” he said. “I don’t dare go out [and find other work].” Get seen where it counts.

        "SOURCE_ID": 81,
        "BODY": "Choosing the best altcoins to buy in 2025 is at the top of every investor’s mind as the market heads into a new cycle of ETF approvals, whale moves, and fresh utility adoption. Coins like Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Polygon MATIC are gaining traction with analysts setting ambitious targets, from Solana’s potential ETF-driven surge to XRP’s regulatory clarity and Dogecoin’s payment integrations. But while these names dominate headlines, smart money is also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star many compare to early meme coin runs that delivered staggering 1000x growth. Solana Price Prediction 2025: The Speed King of Blockchain Solana has kept its name in every best altcoins to buy in 2025 list because of its unmatched performance. The network has already tested over 107,000 transactions per second, proving it can scale without heavy fees. Traders are watching a cup-and-handle formation that could fuel a breakout if SOL crosses the $210 level. Institutional money is flowing too. The REX Shares Solana Staking ETF already surpassed $150 million AUM with record inflows, showing Wall Street appetite for SOL exposure. If the SEC approves spot ETFs in Q4, analysts say Solana could average $425, with optimistic forecasts placing the Solana price prediction 2025 as high as $1,000. XRP Crypto Forecast: The Regulatory Clarity Advantage XRP has delivered one of the strongest breakouts of the year, surging past the $2.90 zone and now eyeing the $5 mark. Analysts believe the next rally could begin if the SEC greenlights spot XRP ETFs by October deadlines. Forecasts suggest up to $8 billion in inflows once approval hits, which could push prices into double digits. Some bullish models place the XRP crypto forecast between $6-$8 by Q4. Beyond ETFs, Ripple is also targeting a U.S. banking charter, which would boost institutional adoption further. Whale activity confirms this bullish setup, with 900 million XRP scooped up in just 48 hours this quarter. The mix of legal clarity, ETF potential, and banking expansion keeps XRP on the shortlist of best altcoins to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Target: From Meme to Payment Utility Dogecoin continues to surprise skeptics. The Grayscale and Bitwise ETF filings add legitimacy, positioning DOGE alongside top-tier crypto assets. Massive whale accumulation of $500 million worth of DOGE this quarter adds weight to bullish projections. Traders are eyeing the Dogecoin price target of $0.45 in a moderate scenario, while optimistic charts push for $1.50 if ETF approvals and payment adoption align. Institutional entry and real-world use cases mean DOGE still carries explosive altcoins for 2025 potential, especially if retail FOMO returns. Polygon MATIC Outlook: The Ethereum Scaling Engine Polygon’s recent on-chain growth is impressive, with over 18.9 million monthly users and $4.12 billion locked across protocols. The Polygon MATIC outlook for 2025 is mixed technically—oversold conditions suggest a rebound from $0.35 support levels, while zkEVM reliability at 99.2% builds confidence for developers. Price targets range from $0.74 to $1.57, which would represent strong gains from its base levels. By combining technical recovery with strong fundamentals, MATIC remains one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for investors seeking Ethereum-linked growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Whales’ Quiet Play While Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and MATIC dominate headlines, analysts are pointing at a quiet trend—capital flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE . Market watchers compare it to past meme coin explosions where early investors captured exponential growth before mainstream hype. Whales are positioning early, suggesting confidence in its long-term narrative. With 1000x crypto potential 2025 speculation building, some believe MAGACOIN could be the hidden gem among explosive altcoins for 2025. Positioning itself as the next meme-driven powerhouse, MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from the same FOMO cycles that once fueled Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Final Thought: Which Coins Could Deliver the Next 1000x? Investors looking at the best altcoins to buy in 2025 are focusing on the four giants—Solana with ETF catalysts, XRP with regulatory clarity, Dogecoin with payments adoption, and Polygon with Ethereum scaling. Each brings unique strengths that support bullish targets. But beyond these well-known names, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds a new flavor of excitement. With analysts comparing it to past meme coin booms, it stands out as a rising project and the best crypto to buy now. For those willing to look beyond the usual suspects, MAGACOIN may be the one altcoin where quiet whale interest could soon turn into mainstream mania.

        "BODY": "Ethereum, Solana, XYZVerse (XYZ), and Chainlink are turning heads as September approaches. These coins show strong promise for significant gains in the coming months. Market watchers point to exciting signs driving renewed attention. Which one could deliver the biggest surprise this year? Dive into the key factors fueling their momentum and discover what sets them apart in 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Source: TradingView Ethereum traded between $4245 and $5136 this week. The coin is up 4.94% in 7 days, 26.08% in a month, and 88.36% over six months. The 10-day average sits at $4740.59, just above the 100-day line at $4593.48. That steady climb keeps eyes on the next move. Energy is cooling. RSI at 40.22 shows demand has dipped, Stochastic at 12.33 points to oversold ground, and MACD is negative at −14.27. These signals hint at short pauses rather than panic. As long as buyers defend 4245, the longer trend that added almost 90% in half a year stays alive. If ETH lifts through $5136, the first test waits at $5492, about 16% above the 10-day average. A clear break could open $6383, nearly 35% higher. Failure to hold $4245 risks a slide to the main support at $3710, roughly −22%, and in a harsher shakeout $2819, about −41%. The past month’s 26% jump suggests momentum favors another run, yet the chart warns that patience may be needed before the next leg. Despite technical cooling, Ethereum bullish future prospects remain intact given ecosystem fundamentals. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView SOL keeps climbing. The token added 6.77% in the past week and 9.28% in the past month. The 6-month gain is a strong 41.54%, lifting price into the $183-$220 range. Buyers are still in control, but the move is calmer than March’s surge. The 10-day average stands at $206 while the 100-day line is $196, so short and long trends point up. RSI near 46 shows neither overbought nor oversold pressure, and a low stochastic at 31 hints at fresh demand. If bulls push above $220, the next ceiling sits at $234. A break there could open a run toward $270, about 22% above today’s high. On the downside, $161 offers the first safety net, roughly 12% below the current low. A slip under that could drag price toward $126, trimming value by about 32%. Given the steady higher lows, a move through $234 looks more likely than a dive to $161, but volume must rise to confirm it. For now, the bias stays mildly bullish with room for a 6%-22% advance if resistance cracks. Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView Chainlink is switching between $23.52 and $28.00 after a slow but steady week. Price rose just 1.29% in 7 days, yet the monthly chart shows a strong 42.12% jump that pushed the token above both its 10 and 100 day averages near 26. During the past 6 months, holders enjoyed a solid 69.87% run. Momentum has cooled. The RSI sits close to 52, right in the middle, while the stochastic reading at 42 hints at no clear trend. The moving averages are almost equal, telling us bulls and bears are locked. The MACD is barely above zero, signaling only mild buying pressure. Traders are watching whether the coin can build fresh energy. If LINK breaks the nearby 30 resistance, the door opens to 34.65. That path would add about 20% from today’s range high. Failure to clear 30 could push the price back to $25, then $21.21, slicing roughly 10% to 25% off recent levels. Long-term charts favor another leg up, but in the short run the coin may consolidate until volume returns. Conclusion ETH, SOL, and LINK strengthen portfolios for the 2025 rally, but XYZVerse (XYZ) fuses sports fandom with meme culture, rewards community, eyes 20,000% upside, and may eclipse prior breakout tokens.

        "BODY": "1. U.S. Macro Data: Inflation & Growth in Focus Core PCE (Fri, Aug 29) – The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. A hotter-than-expected print could reignite rate-hike fears, while softer data may boost risk appetite. Crypto markets often track the dollar and Treasury yields closely—PCE surprises tend to ripple into BTC and ETH. U.S. GDP (Thu, Aug 28) – The second Q2 estimate will provide clarity on growth momentum. Strong growth can push yields higher, weighing on risk assets, while weakness may revive liquidity hopes. Other data: Durable goods (Tue), Consumer Confidence (Tue). Together, they help frame the macro backdrop that dictates risk flows. Why it matters for crypto: Macro liquidity remains a core driver. Lower inflation and weaker growth expectations typically support a “risk-on” move, giving crypto room to rally. Strong data, in contrast, can fuel fears of tighter policy, putting pressure on digital assets. 2. China PMIs: Weekend Surprise Risk China Manufacturing & Services PMIs (Sun, Aug 31, Asia open) These arrive just before Monday trading and can jolt markets if they miss significantly. Weak data often sparks concerns about global growth, weighing on commodities, equities, and indirectly crypto. Why it matters for crypto: Asian liquidity often sets the tone early in the week. A disappointing PMI can trigger risk-off flows, while strong readings may boost confidence and provide support for BTC/ETH. 3. Nvidia Earnings: AI-Liquidity Sentiment Check Wed, Aug 27 – Nvidia reports Q2 earnings. In recent years, Nvidia has become a symbol of AI-fueled growth and liquidity in equities. Its performance frequently spills into tech stocks and broader risk sentiment. Why it matters for crypto: Strong Nvidia earnings can reinforce the “AI + tech growth” narrative that often lifts crypto alongside equities. Conversely, a miss could drain enthusiasm across risk assets. 4. Token Unlocks: Lighter but Still Notable August token unlocks are running ~50% lighter vs July , but investors should note: Echelon Prime (PRIME) begins founder unlocks on Sun, Aug 31 , continuing monthly. Earlier in the month, large unlocks (SUI, APT, ARB, AVAX) have already absorbed market attention. Why it matters for crypto: While this week’s unlocks are smaller, any concentrated selling pressure in thin markets can amplify volatility in those specific tokens. 5. Regulatory Updates: SEC Delays, No Near-Term Decisions The SEC recently delayed multiple ETF rulings (including Solana, XRP, and Trump Media’s Bitcoin+Ethereum ETF) until October 2025. This removes a binary regulatory catalyst from this week’s agenda. Why it matters for crypto: The absence of near-term ETF approvals means the market will lean more heavily on macro drivers and positioning. 6. Market Backdrop: Post-Flash Drop Positioning This week begins after a weekend flash crash in crypto markets , triggered by a mix of macro jitters and large whale supply. Traders will be watching whether dip-buyers step in or if deleveraging continues into the heavy macro calendar. Bottom Line Key Macro Drivers: U.S. PCE (Fri), GDP (Thu), China PMIs (Sun). Equity Spillovers: Nvidia earnings (Wed). Crypto-Specific Flows: Token unlocks (lighter, but PRIME begins). Regulation: SEC decisions pushed out to October. With macro still the dominant force, crypto traders should be prepared for volatility spikes around data releases and earnings. BTC.D and ETH/BTC spreads remain critical pairs to watch for capital rotation signals.",

        "BODY": "Pavel Durov, the founder of messaging platform Telegram, has criticized the ongoing criminal case against him, saying French investigators have failed to find any wrongdoing even a year after his arrest. In a Telegram post on Sunday, Durov described his detention in August 2024 as “unprecedented,” arguing that holding a tech executive accountable for user-generated content is “legally and logically absurd.” According to Durov, Telegram has consistently complied with legally binding requests from French authorities and maintained moderation practices in line with industry standards. Despite this, he is still required to return to France every two weeks , with no appeal date scheduled. Durov warned that the French government’s handling of the case has already inflicted “irreparable damage” to the country’s reputation as a free society. Widespread Criticism of French Authorities Durov’s arrest drew sharp backlash from human rights groups, digital privacy advocates, and the cryptocurrency community, who accused French authorities of attempting to pressure Telegram into adopting stricter censorship measures. Critics argue that targeting the company’s founder over platform misuse by individuals undermines both innovation and free expression. The prosecutors accused Telegram of hosting harmful content and launched an inquiry into its moderation practices. However, the charges have yet to materialize into substantial evidence. French President Emmanuel Macron defended the government’s stance, saying that freedoms must operate within a legal framework to ensure the protection of citizens. He rejected claims of political motivation in Durov’s arrest. However, the President’s statement faced a flood of criticism online. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of blockchain infrastructure firm Helius, questioned Macron directly, asking why the French leader himself was not held accountable for crime in France if the same logic applied to Durov. Telegram Stands Firm on Privacy Durov has reiterated that Telegram will not compromise on user privacy by handing over encryption keys or building backdoors for authorities. He emphasized that the company would rather exit a jurisdiction entirely than submit to censorship demands. The case has since become symbolic of broader debates over digital freedoms, state regulation of social platforms, and the responsibilities of tech leaders in moderating user activity. For Durov, the legal battle is not just personal but also a test of how far governments can push against global platforms without eroding their own credibility on civil liberties.

        "BODY": "Ethereum ( ETH ) is within touching distance of a historic milestone. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is trading at $4,607 on August 25, 2025, down as much as 3% on the day but still hovering near yesterday’s peak of $4,948, which marked a new all-time high. Institutions are increasingly prioritizing Ethereum over Bitcoin, citing its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and scaling through layer-2 networks, ETH exchange-traded funds recorded $3 billion in inflows, outpacing Bitcoin ETFs by a ratio of 17:1 last week. At the same time, technical indicators reveal both strength and caution. Ethereum’s relative strength index (RSI) has reached 75, suggesting overbought conditions that could trigger short-term pullbacks. Analysts also note that unstaking queues and regulatory seizures remain risks worth monitoring. Yet, macro forces are providing fuel for the uptrend. With the Federal Reserve signaling interest rate cuts and the long-awaited Pectra upgrade now live, Ethereum is benefiting from both monetary policy tailwinds and structural network improvements. ChatGPT-5 predicts when Ethereum price with hit $5,000 To get a clearer outlook, Finbold prompted ChatGPT-5 , the latest version of OpenAI’s large language model, to weigh in on when ETH could decisively clear the $5,000 threshold. The AI pointed out that ETH has already “tagged $4,948,” leaving the ceiling “paper-thin,” while stressing that this rally is built on “sustained demand and real infrastructure adoption” rather than speculative hype. “Right now ETH is sitting around $4,600–$4,950 with repeated pushes against $5K. The drivers (ETF inflows, L2 scaling, Fed cuts, and Pectra upgrade) are fundamental catalysts, not just hype. That means the push to $5K isn’t just a technical bounce; it’s backed by sustained demand and real infrastructure adoption,” the model explained. However, ChatGPT-5 also cautioned against expecting a straight-line move higher: “RSI near 75 tells me ETH is stretched short-term, so a dip back to the $4,400–$4,600 zone before a clean breakout wouldn’t surprise me. But the fact that ETH has already tagged $4,948 means the ceiling is paper-thin.” ChatGPT-5’s call says Ethereum will clear $5,000 before the end of August 2025. If momentum holds into September, ETH could establish a higher trading base between $5,200 and $5,600, rather than simply spiking above the milestone once. ChatGPT-5 predicts Ethereum price. Source: Finbold/ChatGPT For Ethereum investors, that makes the next week pivotal. If ETF demand persists and macro conditions stay supportive, the long-awaited $5,000 breakout may be only days away.

Speaking at the digital assets forum WebX2025 in Tokyo on Monday, Minister Kato said that crypto assets belong to diversified portfolios. Finance Minister Highlights Proper Framework Could Mitigate Crypto Risks Minister Kato said that crypto assets have risks surrounding volatility; however, building an appropriate investment environment could help mitigate the risks. “They could be part of diversified investments,” he added. JAPAN'S FINANCE MINISTER: Crypto assets can be part of diversified investments. SBR in Japan incoming? pic.twitter.com/V41Xd4hEPe — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) August 25, 2025 Additionally, he said that the ministry will focus on creating a trading environment for crypto, making sure that innovation isn’t halted due to excessive regulation. In a post on X, André Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, questioned whether Japan’s pivot to crypto regulation would allow for a nation’s strategic Bitcoin reserve. Recently, reports confirmed that Eric Trump will be visiting Japan in September, in a move to expand his family’s Web3 venture. The US President’s son is expected to attend Japanese largest BTC holder Metaplanet’s shareholder meeting. Japan Keeps Up Pace in Digital Asset Regulations The nation’s regulator Financial Services Agency (FSA), approved the issuance of the first yen-denominated stablecoin last week. Tokyo-based fintech company JPYC is expected to spearhead the launch. “Yen stablecoins can streamline cross-border settlement, attract institutional players seeking efficiency, and even support liquidity for government bonds as collateral,” Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, told Cryptonews. Further, realised gains on crypto assets are currently taxed up to 55% in Japan. However, moving to a separate taxation bracket would lower that level to 20%. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Japanese ruling party, has also pledged some important crypto reforms, including introducing equities-style insider trading rules for digital assets that would prohibit malicious actors from profiting from insider trading information. WebX2025, held on August 25–26 in Tokyo, saw Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, and Tokyo Governor’s presence. The event also witnessed industry leaders, including Changpeng CZ Zhao, Justin Sun, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy, and Arthur Hayes of Maelstrom, among others.

        "BODY": "Ethereum just shattered its 2021 record, tagging a fresh all-time high near $4,945 amid a wave of institutional optimism and macro momentum. If this is the start of a new phase, has ETH finally claimed the crypto crown? Record-breaking rally After years of consolidation and builder-driven upgrades, Ethereum (ETH) burst through its prior peak, printing an intraday high around $4,945 over the weekend. At the Ethereum all-time high , market cap hovered just under $600B, cementing its status as the second-largest crypto asset and reigniting the “flippening” debate in market circles. Price trackers and major outlets confirmed the move, with data feeds noting the all-time high in the $4.94K-$4.95K zone. The surge didn’t happen in a vacuum. It arrived as macro risk appetite thawed and crypto-native flows rotated decisively into Ether, intensifying a trend that had been brewing since early summer. $ETH is doing exactly the same thing which led to a massive rally in the 2017 and 2021 cycle. First trap the bulls, and then a capitulation to trap the bears. After that, a new ATH and then an up-only mode for 3-4 months. We have now entered the up-only mode now. pic.twitter.com/DVhfjuGf36 — Ether Wizz (@EtherWizz_) August 23, 2025 What’s fueling the Ethereum price rally Institutional tailwinds. The spot Ether ETFs approved last year and now past their “launch wobble” phase have seen Ethereum ETF inflows . By early August, Bloomberg tallied more than $6.7B year-to-date into the U.S. spot ETH ETFs; mid-month data showed over $1.7B of net inflows in August even as some Bitcoin funds recorded outflows. That reallocation is pivotal: it signals real, sticky demand from institutions building strategic ETH exposure. Beyond ETFs, corporate treasuries buying ETH have also leaned into Ether, adding a structural buyer base that didn’t exist during the last cycle’s peak. Macro catalyst. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks nudged markets toward a September rate-cut probability , dialing down real yields and lifting risk assets, including crypto. Risk-on cues across equities and Asian markets underscored the shift in tone, and Ether’s breakout rode that macro wave. Technical pressure mounts: Squeeze city On the microstructure side, the rally chewed through stacked liquidation zones above $4.7K. Across the broader market, swift spikes around the breakout produced hundreds of millions of dollars in forced liquidations , with ETH-tied liquidations near $388M in 24 hours and roughly $700M+ marketwide during the most volatile windows. Hourly bursts over $300M highlighted just how lopsided positioning had become. That kind of “air pocket” is classic fuel for continuation, when shorts get run over, the bid often chases higher. From here, traders are watching whether the price can sustain closes above the breakout shelf and build a higher base. If momentum holds, chartists will eye round-number psychology at $5,000 and extensions into discovery territory, while a failed re-test could send ETH to back-fill liquidity pockets in the $4,400-$4,600 range before any further advance. 🚨BREAKING: ETH just smashed a new ATH at $4,900! pic.twitter.com/awy6NXDMdt — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 24, 2025 ETH vs Bitcoin – Is the reversal coming? “ ETH vs Bitcoin ” is more than a tribal debate-it’s a capital-allocation question for funds. Multiple datasets now show ETH outpacing BTC in 2025 . The Wall Street Journal’s Jackson Hole coverage pegged ETH’s YTD gains near ~45% versus BTC’s ~25% , and several performance dashboards echo a similar gap. The ETH/BTC ratio has pushed to 2025 highs on the back of ETF inflows and treasury demand. ETH/BTC is just one bullish candle away from its 8-yr downtrend breakout. You're not bullish enough. pic.twitter.com/KmxCQEEwQC — Ted (@TedPillows) August 22, 2025 Why it matters: Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative remains intact, but Ethereum’s programmability, spanning stablecoins, tokenized funds, staking yields, and on-chain capital markets, offers cash-flow-adjacent use cases and a “platform premium” that big money can underwrite. Analysts quoted across mainstream outlets argue that this cycle’s leadership could broaden beyond BTC precisely because ETH is investable through regulated wrappers (spot ETFs) while also being the settlement layer for the fastest-growing on-chain financial primitives. Key risks to the “ETH new crypto king” thesis Buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news. Big round numbers and all-time highs attract profit-taking. A failure to hold above breakout levels could force a deeper mean reversion as funding and leverage reset. Liquidation maps remain a double-edged sword: just as shorts can get squeezed higher, a sharp downdraft can cascade through crowded longs . Macro whiplash. Jackson Hole optimism is still contingent on incoming data. A hot inflation print or hawkish surprise could cool risk appetite quickly, pressuring ETH and ETF flows. ETF flow dependence. While flows are strong, they can reverse. An outflow streak, or regulatory curveball, would test how “organic” spot demand truly is away from the ETF bid. Recent weekly data already show rotation across days. Conclusion Ethereum’s all-time high isn’t just a statistical notch; it’s a signal that capital is re-rating ETH’s role in the digital-asset stack. With ETF inflows , treasury accumulation , and a macro backdrop tilting dovish, the Ethereum price rally has both narrative and numbers behind it. Add in a derivatives market that’s repeatedly mispositioned at key inflection points, and you have the ingredients for continued volatility, and potentially continued leadership in the ETH vs Bitcoin battle. Ethereum’s record run isn’t just statistical, it’s symbolic. As smart money backs its programmability, the question isn’t whether ETH can dominate, but how quickly it might outshine Bitcoin from here. Ready for liftoff? Think Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin in 2025? Drop your target price below and tell us who’s the real king: ETH or BTC? Not investment advice. Crypto assets are volatile and can lose value rapidly.

        "BODY": "Summary COIN remains overvalued and is not a prudent investment for crypto bulls, even after a 25% price drop since my last bearish call. COIN’s fundamentals do not justify its current valuation, especially compared to the more direct crypto asset, Bitcoin. Investing in COIN is riskier than simply holding BTC, as history shows peripheral assets often underperform the main asset. Competition, overvaluation versus established exchanges, and low barriers to entry further undermine COIN’s long-term prospects. I previously issued a bearish call on Coinbase ( COIN ) and since then its stock price has declined by 25%. I continue to hold a bearish view and believe COIN is overvalued and not a good investment for crypto bulls. My reasons are as follows: Analyst COIN rating (Seeking Alpha) #1 Investors must be discerning even in a bull market, to have a margin of safety: I think even if this is a bull market, one has to be discerning. Bull markets can shift to bear markets, and there has to be a defensive element to any investment. i.e., investors that bought BTC during the last peak lost about 77% at the trough (from $69k/coin to $15.5k/coin), but those that bought COIN at the previous peak would have suffered over a 93% drawdown (from $460 to $31). Bitcoin price ( StockCharts ) Coinbase price (Seeking Alpha) #2: COIN does not have the cards (i.e., fundamentals) Then comes the consideration of whether COIN even has the fundamentals to sustain a bull move, which I would evaluate as probably not. Even if an asset class is performing well, different assets benefit differently, and while the difference may not be visible in a few days or a few weeks, it becomes significant over time, and fundamentals eventually drive performance. For example, COIN is up almost 1000% compared to its low point in late 2022, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is “only” up 640%. Yet, BTC has been relatively stable in the past month, while COIN is down 25%. That’s because COIN was being highly undervalued compared to its potential in 2022 (when I made my bullish call during the crypto winter ). But now that COIN’s potential as an exchange is richly priced, COIN’s performance may diverge from that of BTC. Fundamentals are also important as they mark the potential ceiling for an asset. Gold has a market cap of $23 trillion , if BTC proves a capable contender for gold as digital gold, it could aspire to be worth much more than its current market cap of $2.3 trillion. But COIN is only loosely correlated with BTC and crypto. BTC is arguably a store of wealth, while COIN only benefits if people trade crypto. If investors just hold their BTC as a long-term store of value and trade them around less, COIN’s business would dwindle, even if BTC’s value appreciates. More on that below. #3: It may be better to directly invest in the main asset than peripheral assets correlated with the main asset Betting on \"second order effects\" is risky. For example, it's like betting on gold miners instead of just buying gold, while the returns are sometimes higher, there is greater risk and uncertainty of returns compared to just buying the store of value itself. Gold miners have substantially underperformed gold in the past 20 years, as shown below; while GLD (ETF for gold) would have gained 600% in the past 20 years, GDX (ETF for gold miners) would have gained around 50%, with significant drawdowns in between. GLD price history (stockanalysis.com) GDX price history (stockanalysis.com) Junior gold miners (represented by ETF GDXJ) have done even worse, losing value over a 16 year stretch! GDXJ stock price history (stockanalysis.com) While the relationship between miners and gold is not exactly the same as that between COIN and BTC, I think the point is clear, betting on “second order effects” could be dangerous long term. If an investor is bullish on the main asset, it may be better to buy the main asset instead of searching for “extra” gains that might severely underperform the main asset. #4 overvalued comparison with other exchanges When compared with other non-BTC exchanges, COIN is still overvalued, in my opinion. Market cap at Aug 24 2025 ( CME ) $97bn ( ICE ) $103bn ((COIN)) $82bn Source: Seeking Alpha First of all, let’s use gold as an example. Despite being worth $23 trillion, ten times that of BTC, the trading of gold is quite concentrated: over 90% of volume is concentrated in several exchanges. This is quite ominous for COIN, as perhaps eventually most of the crypto volume gets concentrated in a few exchanges as well, diminishing the need for standalone exchanges such as COIN. I would view this as quite likely, after all, if BTC is digital gold, then perhaps the future industry layout of crypto exchanges follows that of physical gold. CME has a strong market share in gold trading volumes , yet its market cap of $97 bn comes from the profits from hundreds, if not thousands, of financial assets, not just gold. I don’t see how COIN could be worth $82 billion in the long run with its share of the crypto market, so I believe the long run COIN market cap has a good chance of reverting to a much lower level. #5 IPO of crypto company Bullish further shows why COIN is not a good investment The IPO of Bullish ( BLSH ) further proves out my point. The barriers to entry are so low that some private equity firms (PEs) can just back another startup to fight for a slice of the pie and an IPO with a current market cap of $10bn. It also means valuations are probably too rich (such as COIN’s $82 bn) to make PEs want to invest in such companies. You don’t see PEs eagerly invest in INTC to spend tens of billions of dollars to upgrade foundries because the return is highly uncertain for the amount invested. But the fact PEs are willing to sink money into yet another crypto exchange shows they see the pay-off at current valuations. Risks to bearish thesis It is possible that market exuberance and general positive environment for stocks and crypto lifts COIN, or COIN could come up with some exciting new products. But I seriously doubt this will change the long-term trajectory. Conclusion COIN is overvalued and not a good way to gain crypto exposure. My latest view of caution is consistent with my previous article. COIN has fallen 25% since my previous article, and I believe it could well fall substantially more even if BTC prices are flat or go up. If an investor is bullish on crypto, he may consider just buying BTC and not COIN.",

        "BODY": "The phrase Top Altcoins To Buy Now still brings names like Stellar, Hedera, and Cardano to mind, tokens with established utility and low price floors. But there’s a fresh name gaining buzz, Remittix. With real-world PayFi infrastructure, public deliverables, and fund volume, RTX is being viewed alongside those legacy picks for near-term upside. Stellar (XLM) remains steady in the range Stellar is at $0.40, losing about 1% in the last 24 hours. The token has seen outflows that are putting pressure on support worth approximately $0.40, even as it is receiving some signals that it will bounce back to $0.45 to $0.47 in the event of more volume. Stellar remains a credible pick for cross-border payments proponents, but any meaningful move likely hinges on renewed institutional engagement or technical triggers. Hedera (HBAR) faces downward pressure despite enterprise interest Hedera trades at $0.24, but is down about 3 to 5 % over the prior week. Key support remains around $0.23, a drop below that risks a deeper sell-off. Yet, momentum could return if enterprise use cases via SWIFT trials and Grayscale filings gain traction. HBAR remains a watchful altcoin, fast, scalable, and enterprise-ready, but currently lacking breakout momentum. Cardano (ADA) tracks broader altcoin crawl with long-term appeal Cardano continues a slow grind just below $1. It offers compelling features like smart contract pathways and institutional partnerships, but lacks immediate breakout catalysts. ADA retains appeal as a long-term structural play with potential upside if macro tailwinds return. Why Remittix (RTX) still tops the “top altcoins to buy now” charts Remittix stands out through visible, tangible progress, not speculative buzz. It has sold over 618 million tokens, is priced at $0.0987, and has raised over $21 million, metrics signalling strong momentum and investor conviction. It just passed the $20 million fundraising milestone, securing its first CEX listing on BitMart. A reveal of its second exchange listing is slated upon hitting $22 million. On the product side, a Q3 wallet beta launch is upcoming, and a $250,000 giveaway is driving early engagement. Key reasons Remittix cuts through the pack: Q3 2025 wallet beta set to bring real access to PayFi functionality Global payout rails already live and are expanding, offering clear utility versus tech speculation Designed for everyday users and real transactions, not hype driven momentum Built for adoption first, not for flash-in-the-pan trades Tailored for freelancers, remitters, and global earners needing instant payout solutions This mix of real-world use, access, and rally-ready catalysts positions Remittix as a standout among the Top Altcoins To Buy Now, with potential sharper upside than the others. Solid names, but RTX has the near-term edge When evaluating the Top Altcoins To Buy Now, Stellar, Hedera, and Cardano bring credibility and mission-backed infrastructure, but current price action is sluggish and tied to long-cycle gains. Remittix, by contrast, offers visible progress, tangible use cases, and imminent catalyst triggers, all while remaining under $0.10. For investors seeking altcoins that are ready to deliver now, not just later, RTX is carving out a clear spot in the spotlight.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Digital Gold: Larry Fink’s Crucial Endorsement Amidst Currency Concerns The financial world is buzzing with a significant shift in perspective from one of its most influential figures. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has publicly endorsed Bitcoin digital gold . This crucial declaration signals a growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency, especially as a hedge against economic instability. Larry Fink’s Transformative View on Bitcoin Digital Gold Larry Fink’s journey with Bitcoin has been quite remarkable. Initially, he viewed Bitcoin (BTC) with skepticism, even considering it a tool for illicit activities like money laundering. However, the unprecedented economic shifts brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a profound re-evaluation of his stance. This change of heart highlights a growing understanding of blockchain technology’s underlying strength and its potential. Past Skepticism: Fink once saw Bitcoin primarily as a means for illicit transactions. Pandemic Catalyst: The global economic response to COVID-19 spurred a re-assessment. New Perspective: He now recognizes the robust nature of blockchain technology. During an interview on Citi’s YouTube channel, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Fink openly shared his evolved view. He now firmly considers BTC to be a form of Bitcoin digital gold , capable of safeguarding assets against the erosion of fiat currencies. This endorsement from such a prominent financial leader is a game-changer for the cryptocurrency market. Why the Shift? Understanding Currency Debasement What exactly led to Fink’s dramatic change of opinion? The concept of currency debasement is central to his new perspective. Fiat currencies, issued by governments, can lose value over time due to various factors, including inflation, quantitative easing, and economic policies. When governments print more money or increase national debt, the purchasing power of existing currency often diminishes. This debasement directly impacts savings and investments, leading individuals and institutions to seek alternative stores of value. Historically, gold has served this purpose, acting as a reliable hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, in the digital age, Bitcoin digital gold is emerging as a compelling alternative. Fink’s comments underscore a broader concern among investors about the long-term stability of traditional financial systems. Therefore, the search for assets that maintain their value independently of government policy is intensifying. Bitcoin Digital Gold: A New Economic Paradigm? The idea of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is not new, but Fink’s adoption of this term gives it significant weight. Like traditional gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply (capped at 21 million coins), making it inherently scarce. This scarcity is a key factor in its potential to act as a store of value, much like precious metals. Moreover, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means it operates independently of central banks and governments. This autonomy offers a unique advantage for those looking to protect their wealth from political interference or economic mismanagement. The underlying blockchain technology provides transparency and security, making transactions immutable and verifiable. Benefits of Bitcoin digital gold as a hedge: Scarcity: Limited supply of 21 million coins. Decentralization: Operates outside government control. Security: Powered by robust blockchain technology. Portability: Easily transferable across borders digitally. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin Digital Gold While the endorsement from a figure like Larry Fink is undeniably positive, the journey for Bitcoin digital gold is not without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a significant hurdle in many jurisdictions, impacting its widespread adoption. Market volatility also presents risks, as Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid fluctuations. However, the opportunities are immense. Institutional interest, as evidenced by BlackRock’s own initiatives (such as their spot Bitcoin ETF application), continues to grow.

        "BODY": "TL;DR Bitcoin futures opened with a massive CME gap, sparking debate on the potential for quick fills near $116,700. Whale dumped 24,000 BTC worth $2.7B, triggering $4,000 price drop and a liquidation cascade. Analysts highlight a $111,900 support zone, with deeper levels near $103K if selling pressure continues. CME Gap Formation Bitcoin futures opened with a wide gap on the CME chart, one of the largest in recent weeks. The range stretches from approximately $113,800 to $116,700, following the substantial crash that occurred on Sunday evening. At press time, Bitcoin was at around $111,400, sitting well below the gap zone. $BTC Opened up with a large CME gap today. This is the largest we’ve seen in several weeks. We have been opening up with gaps pretty often and most of these have been filling on Monday/Tuesday. But I always say that it’s good to be aware of these gaps but don’t use them as… pic.twitter.com/t9gzkNNLHV — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) August 25, 2025 Daan Crypto Trades, who has tracked gap behavior over time, explained that these occurrences often close quickly once trading resumes. “These gaps can work well once price starts closing them and gets close to it. But the further away, the less actionable it becomes,” the analyst said. For now, traders are watching whether momentum is strong enough to bring the price back into the gap for a test. Seasonal Trends and Market Conditions Merlijn The Trader pointed to historical performance during September and wrote, “September has wrecked $BTC holders every single cycle. Bleeds, fake pumps, exhaustion. And then comes October. The month of rebounds.” The comment suggests that volatility and drawbacks may persist into September before a potential recovery in October. Bitcoin’s price has declined nearly 3% in the last 24 hours and by the same percentage weekly. Spot trading volumes remain high as markets adjust to short-term resistance and support tests. In addition, Michaël van de Poppe noted that recent price action is similar to earlier liquidity sweeps. “History repeats and we’re likely seeing a dip beneath the recent lows on $BTC. Great area to accumulate positions,” he said. His chart marks $111,900 as a key level where stops may be cleared before a rebound. Resistance zones sit at $114,800, $116,800, and $119,500. Deeper support is located near $103,190 and $100,800. Trading volume has risen during recent declines, suggesting liquidity is being taken before a potential shift higher. Source: X Whale Activity and Liquidations Analyst ZYN linked the recent volatility to a whale transaction. They reported that 24,000 BTC, worth about $2.7 billion, was sold across several exchanges. The move triggered a $4,000 drop within minutes and caused a wave of liquidations. Despite the sale, the wallet still holds more than 152,000 BTC. “This wasn’t a sell off. It was a liquidation trap,” ZYN wrote. “No structural reason to flip bearish, just more proof whales still control the game.” The sharp move suggests that large holders continue to play a key role in short-term price swings.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Altcoin Futures Open Interest Surges to a Staggering New Peak The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and a recent development in the altcoin space has captured significant attention. The daily altcoin futures open interest has not just risen; it has absolutely surged, hitting an unprecedented all-time high of $61.7 billion. This monumental leap, observed on August 22nd, saw an approximate $9.2 billion inflow in a single day, as reported by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. This rapid expansion of altcoin futures open interest signals a crucial shift in the digital asset landscape. Glassnode highlighted that such swift inflows underscore how altcoins are increasingly becoming the primary drivers of leverage, volatility, and potential fragility across the broader crypto markets. For traders and investors alike, understanding the implications of this surge is paramount. What Does Surging Altcoin Futures Open Interest Truly Mean? When we talk about “open interest” (OI), we are referring to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially in futures, indicates that new money is flowing into the market. In this case, the significant increase in altcoin futures open interest suggests a growing appetite for leveraged bets on altcoins. This surge means more capital is being deployed in speculative positions, often using borrowed funds. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally magnifies losses, introducing a higher degree of risk. The market becomes more sensitive to price movements, with potential for rapid liquidations and cascading effects. Why Are Altcoins Attracting This Unprecedented Leverage? Altcoins, by their nature, often offer higher volatility and the potential for greater percentage gains compared to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This inherent characteristic makes them attractive to traders seeking amplified returns. Several factors contribute to this increased focus on altcoin futures open interest : High Growth Potential: Many altcoins are tied to emerging technologies or niche sectors within crypto, promising significant upside. Market Sentiment: Positive news or general bullish sentiment can drive speculative interest, leading traders to take on more leverage. Innovation and Narrative: New projects and compelling narratives can attract capital, with futures providing a way to bet on their future success without direct spot ownership. Accessibility: Futures markets make it relatively easy for both retail and institutional players to gain exposure to altcoin price movements with leverage. Navigating the Volatility: What Are the Risks? While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the record altcoin futures open interest also brings substantial risks that market participants must acknowledge. The increased leverage can create a more fragile market environment, where sudden price drops can trigger a cascade of liquidations. Consider these potential challenges: Liquidation Cascades: A sharp price decline can force leveraged positions to close, leading to further selling pressure and an accelerated downtrend. Increased Volatility: Higher leverage often translates to more extreme price swings, making market navigation difficult even for experienced traders. Systemic Risk: If a significant number of altcoin positions face liquidation, it could potentially spill over and impact the broader cryptocurrency market. Market Manipulation: High-leverage markets can be more susceptible to large players influencing prices to trigger liquidations. Actionable Insights for Prudent Trading For those participating in or observing the altcoin futures market, a strategic approach is essential. Understanding the dynamics of high altcoin futures open interest can help in making informed decisions. Here are some practical tips: Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Monitor Funding Rates: High funding rates in futures markets can indicate an overheated market, signaling potential reversals. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into highly leveraged altcoin positions. Balance with less volatile assets. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, on-chain data, and analytics from reputable sources like Glassnode to gauge market sentiment and potential shifts. Understand the Underlying Assets: Thoroughly research the altcoins you are trading. Fundamental analysis is still crucial, even in futures markets. A Critical Juncture for Altcoin Futures Open Interest The record-breaking altcoin futures open interest reaching $61.7 billion marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It highlights both the immense potential and the inherent risks associated with the burgeoning altcoin market. While it reflects growing investor confidence and the appeal of altcoins for leveraged trading, it also serves as a stark reminder of the increased fragility and volatility that can accompany such rapid inflows. Navigating this environment successfully requires a deep understanding of market mechanics, robust risk management strategies, and a commitment to continuous learning. As altcoins continue to drive a larger share of market activity, staying informed and cautious will be paramount for anyone engaging with these dynamic digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is altcoin futures open interest? Altcoin futures open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts for altcoins that have not yet been settled. It indicates the total amount of money committed to the market in active positions. 2. Why is a high open interest significant for altcoin futures? A high open interest, especially when rapidly increasing, suggests new capital is entering the market, often through leveraged positions. This can signal increased speculation, potential for higher volatility, and a more fragile market structure. 3. What are the main risks associated with increased altcoin futures open interest? The primary risks include increased market volatility, the potential for liquidation cascades during price drops, and a heightened susceptibility to market manipulation due to amplified leverage. 4. How can traders mitigate risks in a high-leverage altcoin futures market? Traders should prioritize robust risk management, including using stop-loss orders, monitoring funding rates, diversifying portfolios, and staying well-informed about market news and analytics. 5. Does this surge indicate a bullish or bearish trend for altcoins? A surge in open interest itself doesn’t definitively indicate a bullish or bearish trend. It primarily signifies increased market participation and leverage. While it can precede significant price moves in either direction, it also points to heightened risk and potential for volatility.

        "BODY": "The crypto landscape is still active, with coins like Dogecoin at $0.2302 (market cap $34.67Billion) and XRP at a solid $3.01 (market cap $178.97Billion). While the old guard steals the headlines, newer projects are struggling to solve legitimate global problems in ways Dogecoin and XRP don’t. Among the shining lights of 2025 is Remittix (RTX) , a low gas fee cryptocurrency project coming through the presale and upcoming product launch. Market Snapshot: Dogecoin and XRP Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2302, down 2.47% in value. Its market cap stands at $34.67 billion supported by a trading volume of $1.65 billion though the latter has been 69.59% lower. XRP, however, has a greater market depth. The token is priced at $3.01, down by 0.65%. XRP also has a large market cap of $178.97 billion, with the daily trading volume standing at $3.52 billion, though this too has declined by 66.91%. Dogecoin and XRP are examples of how well-established cryptos possess huge liquidity and visibility even after short-term reversals. It is against this wider market background that newer ventures such as Remittix (RTX) with its present price of $0.0969 per token come into their own as the next big altcoin for 2025. Tackling Real-World Payment Challenges Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi solution that aims at the $19 trillion global payment market. Unlike speculative meme coins, RTX focuses on cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions, allowing users to send digital assets to bank accounts in 30+ countries directly. This real-world usability sets RTX apart from community hype tokens. With very low gas fees and borderless cross-settlement, Remittix is among the best DeFi projects 2025 for everyday use. Instant global remittances Efficient real-time FX exchange Supporting 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies Ideal for freelancers, remitters, and businesses Presale Momentum and CEX Listing Remittix is currently priced at $0.0987 for each token and has raised $21.1 million, selling over 618 million tokens. This enthusiasm has laid the groundwork for its first centralized listing on BitMart, offering instant liquidity and greater availability for early holders. The presale also includes a $250,000 Giveaway to encourage early birds and drive increased adoption. With the next milestone coming in at $22 million, set to reveal another CEX partnership, RTX is becoming one of the fastest-growing crypto presales live today. Wallet Launch and Utility Expansion And the other key driver is the forthcoming release of the beta wallet, in Q3 2025. The mobile-first wallet will support direct crypto-to-bank deposits, positioning Remittix as more than a presale hype token. By offering real-world use case solutions such as transparent FX conversion and user-friendliness, Remittix is poised to become one of the top crypto under $1 with long-term adoption prospects. Mobile-first wallet with easy interface Direct settlement to legacy bank accounts Safe platform, certified by CertiK Scaling infrastructure prior to token generation event (TGE) With early adopters already putting RTX on par with an “XRP 2.0,” the project combines utility-driven design with growing community backing.

        "BODY": "Crypto commentator Stellar Rippler has drawn attention to an alleged leak involving Ripple, major global institutions, and the XRP Ledger. According to the post , an ex-banker operating under the alias @LordBelgrave claimed to have disclosed details of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) connected to Ripple and UBS. Within the document, one of the most striking revelations is a reference to “Biometric Identity Mapping,” a concept that links digital identity systems to global settlement networks. This detail further expands the narrative around Ripple’s role in building infrastructure beyond payments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had previously warned in interviews about governments potentially using advanced technology for identity control, which many observers interpreted as comments directed primarily at central bank digital currencies . The suggestion in this leak is that Ripple may have been developing a broader framework connected to digital identity and global payments all along. (1/ ) AN EX-BANKER JUST LEAKED ONE OF RIPPLE’S NDA. And what they’re building with Trump, BlackRock & JPMorgan on XRPL will blow your mind. Suddenly all their strange moves make perfect sense. No one was supposed to know this pic.twitter.com/5iBPZA81p9 — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) August 24, 2025 Digital Identity, Healthcare, and XRP Integration Stellar Rippler’s commentary points to a growing convergence between financial systems, healthcare, and digital identity infrastructure. A notable example highlighted is the announcement from Wellgistics Health, which introduced an XRP Ledger–based payment system for over 6,500 U.S. pharmacies. The integration of instant payments, compliance mechanisms, and standards signals an effort to streamline both financial and health-related data pipelines. This development aligns with JPMorgan’s previously stated position that digital identity will be the foundation of Web3. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has also emphasized this trajectory in its Blockchain Toolkit, which specifically outlines frameworks for digital identity, compliance tracking, and applications in healthcare and supply chains. Ripple’s ongoing presence at global financial policy discussions, with Garlinghouse seen alongside figures such as Christine Lagarde and representatives from the IMF and SWIFT, further strengthens the case for Ripple’s role in shaping cross-sector digital infrastructure. BlackRock, Trump, and Global Strategy Stellar Rippler drew connections between BlackRock, the Trump administration, and Ripple’s activities on the XRP Ledger. The commentary notes that BlackRock’s $XDNA ETF, launched on July 4th, coincided with the rollout of what was referred to as Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which aimed to reduce healthcare costs, along with a broader Digital Health Tech Ecosystem initiative. The implication is that the $XDNA launch on XRPL was deliberately aligned with these policy shifts, positioning XRP Ledger technology as part of a larger healthcare and identity transition. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The suggestion is that Ripple and its partners are laying the foundation for healthcare data and payment systems to operate on-chain. JPMorgan’s push for digital identity integration and Ripple’s continued partnerships in emerging markets reinforce this narrative. Notably, Ripple’s collaborations with Chipper Cash and Onafriq, expanding across Africa and the MENA region, are mentioned alongside the DNA Protocol’s onboarding of laboratories across African nations. According to Stellar Rippler, the combination of an alleged NDA leak, Ripple’s healthcare-related integrations, partnerships across global regions, and institutional alignment with entities, such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, points to a strategic convergence. The emphasis on biometric identity, digital health systems, and compliance standards suggests that Ripple’s role extends beyond payments into the wider domains of healthcare and identity management. Whether these claims prove accurate remains to be seen, but the commentary underlines the extent to which XRP Ledger technology is being linked to global financial, technological, and healthcare infrastructure.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld South Korean Bitcoin Sentiment: Crucial Survey Reveals Shifting Investor Outlook Understanding investor sentiment is crucial in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. A recent survey offers fascinating insights into the current South Korean Bitcoin sentiment , revealing a notable shift in expectations among local crypto enthusiasts. These findings provide a snapshot of how investors in one of the most active crypto markets perceive Bitcoin’s immediate future and the broader altcoin landscape. What’s the Current Bitcoin Outlook Among South Korean Investors? A comprehensive survey, conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between August 18 and 22, tracked weekly trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors. The results indicate a cooling, yet still significant, bullish stance on Bitcoin’s (BTC) price. Bullish Expectations: Approximately 38.3% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin’s value to increase or significantly jump this week. This figure marks a noticeable decrease from the previous week’s 53.2%. Stable Market Predictions: A growing number of investors, 30.2%, now predict a stable market for Bitcoin, an increase from 24.8% last week. This suggests a move towards cautious optimism or neutrality. Bearish Outlook: Conversely, 31.5% of investors foresee a decline or sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value, up from 22% previously. This indicates a growing segment of the market preparing for potential downside. The evolving South Korean Bitcoin sentiment reflects a more nuanced perspective, moving away from overwhelming bullishness towards a more balanced, albeit still hopeful, view of the market. How Optimistic Are South Korean Bitcoin Investors Overall? Beyond specific price predictions, the survey also delved into the overall market sentiment, providing a broader understanding of investor confidence. The results show a mixed bag of emotions: Optimism Prevails (for some): 35.9% of respondents expressed optimism or extreme optimism about the market. This group remains hopeful despite recent shifts. Neutral Stance: A significant portion, 34.1%, reported feeling neutral. This could indicate a ‘wait and see’ approach, or simply a lack of strong conviction in either direction. Fear and Caution: About 30% of investors expressed feelings of fear or extreme fear. This segment is likely concerned about potential market downturns or increased volatility. These figures highlight the diverse emotional landscape shaping South Korean Bitcoin sentiment . While a third of investors remain optimistic, an equal proportion are either neutral or fearful, suggesting a cautious market environment. What’s Next for Altcoins, According to South Korean Bitcoin Sentiment? The survey also explored expectations regarding an ‘altcoin season’ – a period where alternative cryptocurrencies see significant gains. South Korean Bitcoin sentiment on altcoins is varied, reflecting different strategies and beliefs about market drivers. Utility-Driven Gains: 38.5% of respondents anticipate gains limited to select tokens with strong utility or those linked to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This indicates a preference for fundamentally strong projects. BTC and ETH Dominance: 28.5% expect the uptrend to remain confined primarily to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), suggesting a belief in the continued dominance of the top two cryptocurrencies. Broader Altcoin Rally: 20.7% predict a broader altcoin rally, similar to past cycles. These investors are looking for a more widespread surge across the altcoin market. Rally Has Run Its Course: A smaller group, 12.3%, forecasts a decline, believing that the altcoin rally has already peaked. This breakdown offers a fascinating look into the nuanced perspectives of South Korean investors on the altcoin market, ranging from selective growth to broader rallies or even a potential downturn. The overall South Korean Bitcoin sentiment continues to evolve, reflecting global crypto trends while maintaining its unique local characteristics. In conclusion, the latest survey reveals a complex and evolving picture of South Korean Bitcoin sentiment . While bullishness has tempered slightly, a significant portion of investors remain optimistic, especially regarding utility-driven altcoins. The shift towards more stable market predictions and increased caution highlights a maturing market, where investors are increasingly discerning about their strategies.

        "BODY": "Charles Hoskinson used his latest AMA to unleash his most forceful critique yet of the Cardano Foundation (CF), defending the decision to exclude the CF from claiming Midnight’s NIGHT tokens while outlining aggressive multi-chain partnerships, airdrop mechanics he says could be among the largest ever, and a near-term push around Token2049 and an Asia tour. At the center was the Midnight redemption controversy. Asked “to address the decision to limit the CF from claiming NIGHT tokens,” Hoskinson framed the move as a necessary risk control rooted in the airdrop’s terms. “We built it. It’s my money. We can do whatever the hell we want to do,” he said , adding that the distribution included a disclaimer about “undue burden and harm to the network.” Hoskinson Torches Cardano Foundation He asserted ownership of the CF’s ADA is “not clear,” claiming “the Swiss government stole the ADA,” and warned that letting the CF redeem would introduce an adversarial governance bloc: “They’d come in and instantly be adversarial and assert that they have some sort of governance control. Let somebody else have that NIGHT who’s going to do something more with it.” He escalated further later in the stream: “At what point does the community tell the CF to f*** off […] the free [stuff] they already squandered?” and, when pressed on why to blacklist the Foundation’s addresses, replied, “Why invite a bad actor […] into an ecosystem?” He added to his rant: “I’m out there alone and it’s expensive, guys. Some of these deals with the big guys, they’ve become eight figure deals. […] It’s frustrating because all of our competitors have foundations that in some cases have endowments that are in the billions to tens of billions of dollars and they’re hungry and aggressive, and they’re doing stuff and they’re investing in stuff and they’re really pushing things forward.” Hoskinson also insisted that the Midnight rollout materially benefits Cardano rather than siphoning attention from it, pointing to custody and exchange integrations set up to list both Midnight and Cardano-native assets. “We just announced today the Copper partnership[…] any exchange that uses Copper as a custodian […] can now support that asset. And […] they didn’t just agree to support Midnight. They agreed to support Cardano and Cardano native tokens,” he said, grouping Copper with relationships involving Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com and Brave. Hoskinson also said IOHK is working with Chainlink on a first-ever UTXO deployment: “We sat down with Sergey [Nazarov] […] They’re skeptical about the engineering cost […] [but] ‘I think we can figure it out.’” The CF critique broadened into a sweeping governance and resourcing indictment. Hoskinson alleged the Foundation “is just not deploying capital in meaningful ways,” noting its absence from recent conferences: “When I was at Salt […] who wasn’t there? The CF. When we were at Rare Evo […] there was no CF booth.” The Midnight Foundation Is Different By contrast, he cast the Midnight Foundation as aggressively commercial—110 deals in the pipeline and “hungry” account management across ecosystems—and pointed to Intersect, Cardano’s members-based body, as the organ that now embodies his original foundation vision: “You already got a members-based organization […] It took two years to build it […] Now just add like $600 million […] and give them four extra years.” He drew a direct line from CF governance to reputational damage: “Members of the organization are low-key soft accusing us of stealing money […] Were there any apologies? Was there any attempt for reconciliation?” The animus with the CF bled into an evidentiary promise. Hoskinson said the audit report is in the final stages—“we’re so close to the release”—intended to “close out a 10-year history lesson from 2015 to 2025,” including “the original contracts with IO […] how much funds were raised […] the sale […] ADA vouching,” and audits tied to the Cardano Foundation. Hoskinson framed it as “complete exoneration on our part,” and “very damning” for the CF’s “recusal […] of their responsibilities,” arguing that the Foundation’s decision to distance itself from Cardano’s origin story “created a lot of problems.” The purpose, he said, is “sunlight”: “You push it all out there […] and I think those conclusions will be very positive and favorable to Input Output.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.8795.",

        "BODY": "The initiative will begin in Japan and expand to the wider Asia-Pacific region, focusing on tokenizing bonds, enabling cross-chain transactions, and providing on-chain verification for stablecoin reserves. This partnership also follows SBI’s rapid-fire collaborations with Circle, Ripple, and Startale. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet, which is the country’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, was promoted from small-cap to mid-cap status in FTSE Russell’s index review, securing inclusion in the FTSE All-World Index. The company holds nearly 19,000 BTC in its treasury and plans to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027. SBI Group Partners with Chainlink Japanese financial giant SBI Group expanded its push into digital assets through a new partnership with blockchain oracle provider Chainlink, to create tools for financial institutions across Asia. The collaboration was announced on Sunday, and will initially focus on the Japanese market before extending to the wider Asia-Pacific region. According to SBI, the deal will target several key use cases, including tokenizing real-world assets like bonds, enabling cross-blockchain transactions, and providing on-chain verification for stablecoin reserves. This latest move is part of SBI’s aggressive embrace of blockchain technology, and came just days after the conglomerate revealed separate partnerships with Circle, Ripple, and Web3 infrastructure firm Startale. The four announcements in quick succession prove that the company is more than ready to establish itself as a leading force in Asia’s growing tokenized finance sector. SBI said its work with Chainlink will take advantage of the latter’s interoperability protocol to support functions like foreign exchange settlement and cross-border payments. The companies also plan to use Chainlink’s data feed technology to bring net asset value data for tokenized funds on-chain, which could enhance transparency for investors and streamline fund management. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said that the partnership builds on years of collaboration with SBI in areas like stablecoin settlements and fund tokenization, and added that the initiative is moving toward production-level implementation at scale. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao described the deal as a way to support compliant cross-border stablecoin transactions, with the broader goal of accelerating digital asset adoption both in Japan and across Asia. This coincides with growing regulatory momentum in Japan, where the Financial Services Agency is reportedly preparing to approve the country’s first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as next month. The strategy also ties in with SBI’s agreements with Circle and Ripple. Its crypto subsidiary SBI VC Trade plans to launch Ripple’s Ripple USD stablecoin by March of 2026, while also promoting Circle’s USDC in Japan. Additionally, its partnership with Startale will produce a new on-chain platform for trading tokenized stocks and assets around the clock, very similar to platforms operated by Kraken and Robinhood. Metaplanet Added to FTSE All-World Index In other crypto-related news out of Asia, Japan's largest Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet was upgraded from a small-cap to a mid-cap stock in FTSE Russell’s September 2025 Semi-Annual Review , securing its inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index. The promotion happened after the company’s strong second-quarter performance and means it will now also join the FTSE All-World Index, which tracks the biggest publicly listed companies across regions. The inclusion is expected to channel more capital into Bitcoin from traditional financial markets, giving passive stock investors indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency through their index holdings. The company’s impressive rise is turning heads as it continues to outperform some of Japan’s most established corporations. According to its Q2 financial report , Metaplanet posted year-to-date gains of nearly 187% by August. This was far above the 7.2% rise of the TOPIX Core 30 Index, which tracks blue-chip companies like Toyota, Sony, and Nintendo. Currently, Metaplanet holds 18,991 BTC in its corporate treasury, making it the seventh-largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder worldwide. That puts it ahead of well-known companies like Coinbase, Tesla, and Hut 8. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) It was originally operating as a hotel business, but Metaplanet pivoted in 2024 to become a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company. The rebrand was accompanied by an ambitious long-term strategy to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is 1% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply. In July, CEO Simon Gerovich suggested that part of the company’s Bitcoin reserves could be deployed toward acquiring more income-generating businesses, including the potential purchase of a digital bank or ventures adjacent to the digital asset sector. The recognition by FTSE Russell sheds some light on Metaplanet’s transformation from a niche hotel operator into a major player in both Japan’s equity markets and the global Bitcoin ecosystem.

The company announced the purchase of 103 more Bitcoins (BTC) for approximately 1.736 billion yen (approximately $11.78 million). Metaplanet Increases Bitcoin Investment: Purchases 103 More BTC With this latest acquisition, Metaplanet's total Bitcoin holdings reach 18,991 BTC. The company's total crypto investment has reached 285.833 billion yen (approximately $1.942 billion). Metaplanet considers Bitcoin a long-term reserve asset and positions it as a key strategic asset on its balance sheet. The company's decision to increase its Bitcoin investments reflects the increasing global interest in digital assets among institutional players. Inflation, monetary policy, and geopolitical uncertainties, in particular, are accelerating the shift by large corporations toward alternative value preservation tools beyond traditional financial assets. With this move, Metaplanet has become one of the largest institutional Bitcoin investors in Asia. Experts say the company's strategy is similar to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin buying policies in the US. As crypto markets have matured in recent years thanks to institutional investment, Metaplanet's progress is being closely watched both in Japan and internationally. It's anticipated that the company will further expand its Bitcoin reserves with new purchases in the future. *This is not investment advice.

        "BODY": "Institutional developments dominate the cryptocurrency market amidst wild macro-fueled volatility. On August 11, Nasdaq firm Heritage Distilling announced plans to launch a $220 million PIPE financing for a Story ($IP) treasury reserve. Leading investors, including a16z, Amber Group, and Hashed, participated in the financing, which comprised $120 million in $IP coins and cash worth $100 million. The initiative included allocating $82 million to accumulate $IP tokens, and the Story team has confirmed it will buy back the native token in the next three months. The asset repurchase program started officially after the duo closed the deal on August 15, running until November 16. The Story team declared: As promised, the Story Foundation will carry out the $82M buyback program on the open market, running through November 16, 2025. The 90-day window began on August 15, 2025, following the official deal closure. Story @StoryProtocol · Follow On August 15, 2025, Nasdaq: $CASK officially closed the PIPE financing to establish a treasury strategy focused on $IP .As promised, the Story Foundation will carry out the $82M buyback program on the open market, running through November 16, 2025. The 90-day window began on 3:30 am · 25 Aug 2025 31 Reply Copy link Read 11 replies Story’s $82M buyback program The massive repurchase initiative is a crucial move in Story’s treasury strategy. The project will use the funds to improve its ecosystem. Notably, Story Protocol will commit the $82 million to buy $IP coins at $3.40 per token on the open market. The move signals Story’s confidence in the native token’s long-term potential. Further, this can mean additional opportunities for the $IP community. Firstly, the buyback program will ensure constant liquidity for Story investors. That’s crucial to reinforce stability during the protocol’s maturity. Also, the initiative demonstrates institutional-grade dedication to programmable intellectual property as a legitimate asset class. For $IP holders, the buyback serves as both a signal of trust in Story’s future ecosystem performance and a stabilising tool. Unlocking an $80T market Intellectual property is among the most valuable sectors, worth approximately $80 trillion, according to Story Protocol. However, it remains challenging to value or trade. That’s where programmable IP (intellectual property) comes in. It introduces blockchain-based solutions that allow tokenisation of royalties, ownership, and rights. Programmable IP promises businesses, investors, and creators fair benefits from intellectual property, especially as artificial intelligence continues to transform industries. According to the Story Foundation: IP is an $80T asset class and the lynchpin to AI’s advancement. This new treasury unlocks market access to a new kind of digital asset that is grounded in real-world economic fundamentals: licensing, royalties, ownership, and data provenance in the age of AI. $IP price outlook The native token reflected broad market performance. $IP has dropped more than 3% in the past day to $5.71. Chart by CoinMarketCap The altcoin’s structure displayed significant bearishness, hinting at further short-term dips before possible bounce-backs. Technical indicators support Story Protocol’s downside trend. Thus, broader sentiments will shape $IP’s short-term price trajectory, with institutional interest positioning the token for impressive performance in the coming weeks and months.

        "SOURCE_ID": 69,
        "BODY": "For years, XRP has been promoted as a bridge currency for banks and financial institutions. Yet despite partial adoption, the growth in value has been slower than expected. Many investors who held XRP during past cycles often ask themselves why crypto is down in broader markets when projects like XRP haven’t delivered the explosive upside they anticipated. This is why attention is shifting toward new-generation projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which combines decentralized lending, innovative stablecoin mechanics, and revenue-backed staking rewards. While XRP remains a long-term story of regulatory clarity, MUTM is already capturing whales looking for faster ROI in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has designed a dual lending system: P2C lending gives users instant access to liquidity by interacting directly with smart contract pools, while P2P lending allows custom terms between lenders and borrowers for more flexible deals. On top of that, the protocol is preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin that will always aim to stay at $1, creating reliability even during a crypto crash. This utility-driven structure ensures that demand for MUTM is not based on speculation alone, but on features that directly attract both retail and institutional users. Adding another layer, all deposits generate mtTokens, which are ERC-20 assets that represent deposits and accrued interest. These tokens not only grow in value as interest accumulates but are also eligible for staking. mtToken stakers will receive MUTM rewards bought back from open-market revenue, building sustainable buy pressure. Unlike XRP, which depends largely on external adoption, MUTM is creating a closed-loop system where activity inside the platform directly translates into value for token holders. Presale gains already outpacing traditional plays Investors are closely tracking the presale progress of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently in Phase 6 at $0.035. So far, $14.83 million has been raised, 25% of tokens in this round are already sold, and the community has grown to more than 15,650 holders. The next price level will be $0.04, meaning those who enter now are securing their position at a discount before the final stages of presale. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a planned listing price of $0.06, the window for early accumulation is narrowing rapidly. The ROI potential has already been demonstrated. For example, an investor who rotated funds from XRP into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2 at $0.015 is already looking at 2.3x growth, even before the token is live on exchanges. By contrast, XRP investors waiting years for similar returns have often been left frustrated. This speed of growth shows why seasoned traders are diversifying away from slow-moving assets into projects like MUTM that align directly with the current DeFi trend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also adds credibility through security and transparency. The project has passed an audit by CertiK with strong scores, demonstrating a commitment to building a trustworthy protocol. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program with severity-based rewards incentivizes independent developers to keep the system safe. A $100,000 giveaway is underway to reward the community and fuel engagement. These initiatives show that the team is not only focusing on growth but also protecting investor confidence. Why MUTM is positioned for higher ROI than XRP The upcoming roadmap outlines a clear path to adoption in four phases: introduction, building, finalizing, and delivering. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to enter its beta launch and begin exchange listings, which are expected to include top-tier CEXs like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase. Each milestone represents a demand surge, as broader accessibility often drives higher crypto prices today. Beyond the launch, the project has plans for multi-chain expansion and advanced features that can cement its place in the decentralized finance ecosystem. Unlike XRP’s slow trajectory, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to accelerate quickly because its design funnels real usage into continuous buybacks of the MUTM token. As lending volumes increase, more revenue will be directed into market purchases of MUTM, distributing rewards to mtToken stakers. This model sustains demand long after the presale ends and creates consistent upward pressure on value. With Layer 2 growth across the industry and the rising appetite for decentralized lending platforms, MUTM is positioned to capture adoption at scale. Investors are noticing that Phase 6 is already 25% sold, and the next price jump is imminent. Those waiting too long risk missing the final discounted entry point before listing. As XRP continues to grow slowly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the high-velocity alternative where ROI is not a long-term hope but a near-term expectation. For those seeking the strongest crypto investment opportunities of 2025, the path is becoming clear: MUTM offers the scale, speed, and structure to outperform legacy projects and set the pace for the next cycle.

        "BODY": "Crypto markets are experiencing a seismic shift as Solana and Dogecoin surge over 510%, while the Ethereum price flirts with new all-time highs. Yet, it is Layer Brett’s explosive presale and innovative memecoin utility that is captivating investors seeking the next big altcoin. The crypto presale for $LBRETT is live, offering early-access pricing at just $0.0047 per token, and analysts predict this Layer 2 powerhouse could easily 100x in the upcoming crypto bull run. With institutional money pouring into Ethereum and meme coins dominating the headlines, Layer Brett positions itself as the most scalable and rewarding memecoin to ever launch on Ethereum Layer 2. Why Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge over Solana and Dogecoin Unlike traditional meme tokens like Dogecoin and Brett, Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology for near-instant transactions and ultra-low gas fees. While Solana is known for speed and scalability, Layer Brett processes transactions off-chain but remains anchored to Ethereum for maximum security and decentralization. Gas fees drop from $10–$20 on Layer 1 to mere pennies, making $LBRETT accessible to everyday users and DeFi coin enthusiasts. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent tokenomics, the project stands apart from basic meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Shiba Inu. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers as Solana and Dogecoin pump While Solana and Dogecoin are seeing dramatic price action, $LBRETT’s presale offers unique upside for early backers. Investors can buy and stake $LBRETT using ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet, with an eye-popping APY of over 12,580% for staking. Unlike Brett on Base, which lacks real utility, Layer Brett offers staking with no KYC and full self-custody. Early supporters benefit from: Massive staking rewards (APY over 12,580%) Entry price at just $0.0044 per token Seamless purchase and staking process Immediate staking via dApp Solana price is skyrocketing, but Layer Brett is capturing the market’s attention Despite Solana’s current price of $207.99 and Dogecoin’s $0.2365, both remain basic meme tokens or general altcoins without the evolving ecosystem that Layer Brett promises. With Ethereum price hitting $4,751.60 and institutional adoption rising, the appetite for scalable, utility-rich projects is at an all-time high. Layer Brett is not just riding the meme wave like Pepe or Brett, it is building a genuine Layer 2 ecosystem with staking, NFT integrations, and future DAO governance, all designed for the next 100x meme coin run. What makes Layer Brett different from Brett, Dogecoin, and Solana While Solana and Dogecoin have achieved legendary status among top-gainer crypto coins, Layer Brett deliberately fuses meme culture with real blockchain utility. Unlike the original Brett on Base, which lacked functional utility, this project delivers: True Layer 2 scaling and low gas fees Gamified staking and community-first tokenomics Transparent max supply (10 billion) and clear allocation Ongoing roadmap with DAO and NFT expansion Conclusion: The best crypto to buy now before the next bull run As Solana and Dogecoin ride renewed hype and Ethereum price approaches record highs, Layer Brett stands out as this cycle’s best crypto presale and the next 100x meme coin contender. With a much smaller market cap than Solana, Dogecoin, or Brett, $LBRETT offers unmatched upside potential, explosive staking rewards, and genuine Layer 2 innovation. Don’t miss your chance to join the next top meme coin and stake for potentially life-changing rewards.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling the Dominant Tokens in K-Community Are you curious about the pulse of the cryptocurrency market in South Korea? Understanding the latest Korean crypto trends is absolutely crucial for anyone tracking global digital asset movements. This week, we dive deep into the fascinating data from Bitcoin World, revealing which tokens captivated the attention of the South Korean crypto community, often referred to as the K-Community, between August 15 and 21. Unveiling Top Korean Crypto Trends: Most Searched Tokens The K-Community showed immense interest in a diverse range of digital assets. Here is a breakdown of the top 10 tokens that users actively searched for during the specified period, reflecting significant Korean crypto trends in engagement: XRP: 70,014 searches – XRP truly dominated, indicating strong community interest and perhaps anticipation around its legal developments or utility. ETH: 24,831 searches – Ethereum consistently ranks high, driven by its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. SOL: 24,321 searches – Solana continues to capture attention, likely due to its performance and ecosystem growth. ADA: 19,191 searches – Cardano maintains a dedicated following, with ongoing development news fueling searches. STRIKE: 18,099 searches – Strike’s appearance is notable, suggesting growing interest in payment solutions or specific project updates. DOGE: 17,931 searches – Dogecoin remains a popular choice, often influenced by social media sentiment. LINK: 16,986 searches – Chainlink’s oracle services are vital, explaining consistent search volume. ENA: 12,666 searches – Ethena’s presence highlights emerging narratives or specific community campaigns. BTC: 9,882 searches – Bitcoin, the market leader, always draws attention, though it was outranked by several altcoins in this period. ONDO: 7,464 searches – Ondo Finance’s focus on real-world assets (RWAs) could be a driving factor here. This data offers valuable insights into what the K-Community actively researches. It suggests a focus beyond just the largest cryptocurrencies, with specific projects gaining significant traction. What Tokens Dominated Mentions in Key Korean Crypto Trends? Beyond just searching, what were K-Community members actively discussing? The list of most mentioned tokens provides another lens into Korean crypto trends and market sentiment. These are the tokens that generated the most conversation: BTC: 1,338 mentions – Bitcoin consistently leads discussions, reflecting its status as a market benchmark and a primary topic for analysis. ETH: 1,320 mentions – Ethereum also features prominently in conversations, often regarding its network upgrades or DeFi ecosystem. SOL: 405 mentions – Solana’s performance and ongoing developments likely fuel its mentions. STRIKE: 297 mentions – Strike again appears, indicating that its search interest translates into active discussion. XRP: 277 mentions – While XRP was the most searched, its mention count is lower, suggesting more individual research than communal discussion during this specific week. TRUMP: 206 mentions – The appearance of “TRUMP” is intriguing, potentially linked to political meme coins or related news. ADA: 170 mentions – Cardano’s community remains vocal about its progress. LINK: 143 mentions – Chainlink’s utility ensures it remains a topic of conversation. WAVES: 111 mentions – Waves protocol mentions could stem from specific project updates or community initiatives.

        "BODY": "Smart money tends to position before headlines. That pattern will repeat as whales accumulate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized, non-custodial platform that will bring fluid lending and borrowing to both blue chips and meme coins. During a crypto crash, big buyers look for utility and clear catalysts rather than hype, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that brief with a two-track design: P2C pools for stablecoins and top assets, and a separate P2P lane for speculative tokens. The structure will keep core liquidity efficient while still opening high-yield opportunities for risk-takers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized stablecoin will aim to hold $1 through overcollateralized borrowing. Only approved issuers will mint it, issuance limits will manage risk, and governance will adjust the borrowing rate to help the price stay at $1. Arbitrage and automatic liquidations will do the rest. On the earning side, depositors will receive mtTokens that represent their share of the pool and grow in value as interest accrues. Those mtTokens will also be usable as collateral, creating a smooth loop between saving and borrowing. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it to mtToken stakers, so staking will turn fee growth into steady buy pressure and ongoing rewards. Anyone wondering why crypto is down in choppy months will soon focus less on headlines and more on systems that will pay out from real activity. In the middle of this build, the presale is delivering clear signals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 at $0.035 with $14.83M+ raised, 25% already sold, 15,650+ holders, and a total supply of 4B tokens. Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.04, about a 15% step-up. An early buyer in Phase 1 at $0.01 now sits on 3.5x mark-to-presale value before listing—performance that outclasses what most investors see by simply waiting on BTC or SOL over the same window. That is the kind of clean, math-first outcome whales favor. Trust and safety already sit at the front of the story. CertiK’s review shows a 95 Token Scan score and a 78 Skynet score, adding third-party visibility into quality. The $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK is live, tiered by severity to reward responsible disclosure at every level. Community growth will keep momentum with the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each. Instead of chasing headlines or staring at crypto prices today, the market will follow incentives, audits, and working mechanics. Phase 6 momentum, real utility, and the road to listings The value engine behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will come from usage. P2C pools will adjust rates by utilization, drawing in lenders when borrowing heats up and cooling demand when it stretches too far, so solvency and efficiency will stay aligned. mtTokens will remain ERC-20 assets that accrue interest in real time, redeemable for principal plus yield subject to liquidity, and transferable across DeFi. A straightforward example shows the power: a $15,000 USDT deposit will issue mtUSDT 1:1, and at a 15% average APY, that position earns $2,250 in a year. On the borrowing side, locking $1,000 in ETH will unlock up to 75% LTV in liquidity while preserving exposure to future ETH gains. Execution will keep compounding advantages. The team will launch a beta around the token go-live, so users will test the core flow early. Layer-2 integration is being built to deliver lower costs and faster confirmations, removing the pain points that slow adoption elsewhere. Expected exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase will open the door to fresh capital and liquidity, multiplying the impact of the buy-and-distribute cycle that will purchase MUTM from the market and reward mtToken stakers. As activity grows, more revenue will feed buybacks, and more buybacks will reinforce demand. For anyone building a long-term crypto investment plan before the next Ethereum (ETH) breakout, the path is clear: utility that will pay, a presale price ladder with visible steps, audits and incentives that will protect the community, and whales already leading the way. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will move from Phase 6 to Phase 7 with a built-in price lift and a roadmap that stacks Beta, Layer-2 performance, and major listings in the right order. Whales are already in; retail will follow the signal.

        "BODY": "As Solana (SOL) continues its march back toward the $200 mark, thousands of investors are glued to crypto charts, waiting for the breakout moment. Yet history shows that by the time the spotlight is on the big names, the real opportunity is already gone. Just like early Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were once overlooked when they traded for cents, a hidden altcoin priced at just $0.035 is building momentum to repeat that cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale, but with its unique DeFi mechanics and fast-growing traction, it is shaping up as one of the most attractive crypto coins before the next bull wave begins. Real DeFi utility driving future demand Unlike speculative tokens with no real use case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed around practical lending and borrowing functions that will fuel ongoing demand. Through its peer-to-contract (P2C) model, investors will be able to supply assets directly to liquidity pools and earn steady yields. For example, a lender depositing $25,000 AVAX at 65% loan-to-value (LTV) will be positioned to earn 14% APY, which equals $3,500 annually. On the borrowing side, a user pledging MATIC at 70% LTV will unlock liquidity without selling their holdings, keeping exposure to future price growth while accessing usable capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also integrates a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for more flexible arrangements. Instead of relying only on pool rates, lenders and borrowers will directly negotiate terms. That means tokens such as DOGE or SHIB will be matched in one-on-one deals, letting lenders demand higher yields in exchange for taking on higher risk. This separation ensures blue-chip assets flow through stable pools while more volatile assets are isolated, giving participants both safety and flexibility. This two-tier lending system sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart. It blends efficiency with customization and is designed to attract both conservative depositors and risk-seeking investors, ensuring liquidity on both ends of the platform once it goes live. Presale momentum and price projection Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035. Over $14.83 million has been raised, 25% of the tokens are already sold, and the project has surpassed 15,650 holders. Security and transparency are reinforced by a completed CertiK audit, which returned scores of 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. To further strengthen confidence, the team has introduced a $50,000 bug bounty program with severity-based rewards and a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 lucky winners. With over 12,000 followers on Twitter, community traction is building quickly, showing a groundswell of anticipation ahead of launch. The trajectory is already mirroring how successful projects like Solana (SOL) grew from modest beginnings. Take this example: an investor who swapped $8,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) during Phase 2 at $0.015 would already be sitting on $18,500 in Phase 6. That’s a more than double return before the platform has even launched. Once the beta goes live and lending demand kicks in, this compounding effect is expected to grow stronger. Just as Solana (SOL)’s recovery will be driven by rising network activity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to be powered by its buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This ensures continuous buy pressure and rewards long-term participation, aligning incentives between investors and the platform itself. Combined with audited smart contracts and future CEX listings that are expected to increase accessibility, institutional trust, and demand, are projected to expand. The presale is also structured with gradual price increases, reinforcing urgency. Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.04, representing a 15% rise from today’s level. Investors who delay will face higher entry costs, and this is likely the last opportunity to secure MUTM under 4 cents before mainstream exposure accelerates adoption. A timely answer to the question of 2026 For anyone asking if crypto is a good investment going into 2026, the answer lies in recognizing undervalued assets before they explode. Just as the earliest Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) adopters benefited from spotting utility before the crowd, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now laying the foundation for exponential growth. It offers a rare mix of DeFi innovation, audited security, and community traction at a presale price point that still leaves immense upside. While many investors are busy chasing Solana (SOL)’s climb back to $200, the smarter move is investing in crypto projects that are still under the radar but designed with long-term sustainability in mind. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already shown strong presale demand, transparent development, and real-world application through its P2C and P2P lending models. As the beta launch approaches and liquidity flows into the system, its growth path is expected to resemble the early days of market giants. The clock is ticking. With Phase 7 on the horizon, entry under $0.04 is about to close. For those looking beyond the surface of crypto charts and hunting for the next major success story, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the hidden altcoin worth serious consideration before 2026.

        "BODY": "Bitcoin’s jump from Friday was short-lived as the asset was not only stopped at $117,000 during the weekend, but it took another turn for the worse on Sunday evening and Monday morning. Most altcoins have followed suit by turning red, with ETH dropping by over 3% daily, while XRP has slipped below the crucial support at $3. BTC Falls Hard Last week was a tough one for the primary cryptocurrency as it was gradually declining for the most part. The culmination took place on Friday, ahead of Jerome Powell’s highly anticipated speech, when it slipped to a multi-week low of just under $112,000. As the Fed Chair hinted at potential future rate reductions, BTC reacted with an immediate surge , driving it to over $117,000 within minutes. That was as far as it would go, though, as bitcoin quickly retraced to $115,000, where it spent most of the weekend. As it seemed like more action would follow on Monday, the tables turned on Sunday evening. In a sudden and unexpected price drop, bitcoin’s price tumbled by several grand to under $111,000, a level not seen since July 10. Although it bounced off at first to over $113,000, the bears appear to be in control now as they have pushed BTC south to well below $112,000 as of press time. Its market cap has dropped to $2.225 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is just over 56% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Retrace Mode Most altcoins have turned red on a daily scale as well. Ethereum, which set yet another new all-time high at $4,950 yesterday, has plunged to just over $4,600 as of now. XRP was rejected at $3.1 yesterday and now struggles below the coveted $3 support line. SOL, ADA, TRX, DOGE, XLM, and LINK have posted similar losses. SUI, LTC, AAVE, PEPE, ENA, MNT, OKB, UNI, and ETC have declined even further, with daily drops of up to 7-8%. The cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets has plunged by roughly $200 billion since yesterday to $3.930 trillion as of now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

        "BODY": "Ripple’s XRP has once again reminded investors of its strength, climbing to $2.92 after an impressive 20% weekly adjustment. The move has reignited excitement across the market, but it has also sparked a familiar question: what comes next? Traders know that once a major coin rallies, the hunt begins for the next under-$1 opportunity with room for explosive upside. That search is now pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a project still in presale but already generating serious momentum. Ripple (XRP) climbs to $2.92 Ripple’s XRP surged 20% over the past week, reaching ~$2.92 as of August 23, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.7 billion. The rally follows the SEC’s final dismissal of its lawsuit against Ripple, affirming XRP’s non-security status for retail sales and a reduced $50 million fine. Whale accumulation of $1 billion and ETF approval odds hitting 95% fuel bullish sentiment. Technical indicators show XRP breaking $2.80 resistance, with RSI at 60 and support at $2.65. A $3 million raise for an XRP Ledger DeFi protocol adds momentum. Analysts project a $3.50 target if $3.00 clears, but macro pressures like U.S.-China trade tensions pose risks. A drop below $2.65 could test $2.40. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a protocol built for real utility The difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and countless low-priced tokens flooding the market is simple: actual purpose. Instead of speculation alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized liquidity protocol where lenders and borrowers engage in a secure and non-custodial environment. In its peer-to-contract (P2C) model, users will interact directly with liquidity pools, earning interest or gaining access to capital without intermediaries. In the peer-to-peer (P2P) system, rates will be negotiated directly between lenders and borrowers, offering flexibility and control. This combination represents a dual-engine approach—one designed to satisfy both everyday users seeking passive income and more sophisticated traders who prefer tailored arrangements. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also engineered for efficiency. By building on Layer-2, it avoids the congestion and high fees that have plagued older DeFi platforms still relying on Layer-1. That means faster settlements, lower costs, and an experience designed for adoption at scale. Add to this the development of a decentralized stablecoin that will stay pegged to $1 through governance-controlled interest rates and overcollateralized loans, and the foundation for lasting demand begins to look very solid. Unlike projects that rely solely on promises, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will roll out its beta launch simultaneously with its token listing. This ensures utility from day one, driving immediate activity into the ecosystem. Lenders will begin earning and borrowers will start unlocking liquidity right from the outset, creating the type of sustainable adoption that fuels long-term growth. Presale strength and investor urgency The presale journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, priced at just $0.035 per token. Over $14.83 million has already been raised, with more than 15,650 holders onboard and 25% of this round already snapped up. Once Phase 7 begins, the price automatically increases by 15%, making this the final window for investors to secure a position before costs rise. The psychology of timing in crypto is powerful. During a crypto crash, latecomers often regret ignoring earlier signals, while early entrants reap the rewards. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM), traders are watching crypto charts closely because they know momentum is building fast, and hesitation could mean missing one of 2025’s defining opportunities. Confidence in the project has been reinforced by its security credentials. A CertiK audit gave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, reflecting the team’s commitment to transparency and safety. To further engage the community, a $50,000 bug bounty program is active with severity-based rewards, alongside a $100,000 giveaway that will award ten winners. These elements not only attract users but also help build a strong ecosystem around the token before its listing. The growth vision extends far beyond the presale. Once the token lists at $0.06, liquidity and visibility are expected to expand rapidly through integrations on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. Such exposure is not just about accessibility; it also invites comparison with existing protocols, where Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s combination of Layer-2 efficiency, lending innovation, and stablecoin design is set to stand out. Market watchers and influencers are increasingly weaving MUTM into their crypto predictions, suggesting that what starts as a presale story could quickly become one of the most talked-about launches of the year. The final word Ripple (XRP)’s surge has been a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in crypto prices, but investors looking for the next breakout opportunity are setting their sights elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines the credibility of a strong audit, the innovation of dual lending models, and the urgency of a presale already 25% through Phase 6. With a beta launch rolling out at listing and top exchange integrations ahead, this is not a speculative gamble on vaporware but an early-stage window into a functioning DeFi ecosystem. For those seeking to ride the next wave rather than chase yesterday’s rally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) looks primed to be the under-$1 token that redefines early investment success in 2025.

        "SOURCE_ID": 69,
        "BODY": "When investors look back at the journey of Cardano (ADA), the biggest lesson is patience combined with strong fundamentals. ADA holders who believed in its roadmap-driven development saw massive ROI when the market recognized its long-term value. Today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being viewed as the next DeFi project that can repeat this success story, but on a faster timeline. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not another meme-driven name rising and falling with hype. It is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where lenders deposit into liquidity pools to earn interest while borrowers secure overcollateralized loans. What makes the system even more innovative is the two lending models it introduces. Peer-to-contract (P2C) lending allows borrowers to interact with liquidity pools directly, while peer-to-peer (P2P) lending gives lenders and borrowers freedom to negotiate terms with one another. Both of these models are designed to reshape decentralized lending, with flexibility for both sides. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stablecoin Unlike meme assets that depend on trends, MUTM is also building a decentralized stablecoin that will always aim to remain at one dollar in value. This stablecoin will only be minted against collateral and will be burned on repayment or liquidation, keeping supply balanced. Arbitrage and governance-managed interest rates will help ensure that the stablecoin remains stable even when the broader market faces pressure, such as a crypto crash. This mechanism is another sign that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed for long-term adoption, rather than short-lived market buzz. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap mirrors ADA’s strategy of steady development. Phase 2 covers the core smart contract development, front-end and back-end builds, code reviews, and risk management tools. Phase 3 will lead to a beta testnet demo, functional demo release, further external audits, and preparations for exchange listings. In Phase 4, the project will deliver the live launch, token claim, listings on major exchanges, multi-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships. The strength of this roadmap, paired with real lending demand, positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capture the kind of trust ADA earned in its early years, but on an accelerated path. Presale gains already showing ADA-like patience paying off Presale performance is further reinforcing this comparison. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, with over $14.83 million raised, 25% of tokens already sold, and more than 15,650 holders. The price is set to climb again in Phase 7 to $0.04, signaling urgency for retail investors and whales who want early entry before the jump. Early participants are already sitting on serious ROI. For example, an investor who entered Phase 3 at $0.02 now holds tokens worth 3x that value once listing happens at $0.06. That is the kind of return ADA holders had to wait years for, while MUTM is delivering it even before exchanges list it. This shows how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards early conviction and long-term vision. Security has also been a top priority, which reassures those building long-term crypto investment portfolios. The project has already passed a CertiK audit, scoring 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. To go even further, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a bug bounty program with rewards of up to $2,000 for severity-based findings, and a $100,000 giveaway spread among ten winners to expand community engagement. These are not short-term campaigns but clear moves to strengthen trust and broaden adoption. What excites larger investors is the sustainable tokenomics. A portion of revenue generated by the platform will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates continuous buy pressure and a reason for investors to hold rather than sell quickly. Unlike meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE that rely on hype, this buyback-and-distribute system builds a cycle of stability and growth that can scale with user activity. Conclusion As expected, exchange listings on platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and MEXC become a reality, liquidity will expand, and more retail traders will be able to access MUTM. With crypto prices today still in recovery and investors asking why crypto is down, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an answer: utility-driven projects will always outlast hype. By the time 2026 arrives, price projections for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already being talked about in the range of $0.12 to $0.20. This trajectory comes from its Layer 2 growth, real DeFi use cases, and the steady buyback pressure rewarding participants. Where ADA once delivered massive ROI through patience, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing signs it will achieve the same for the next wave of believers. For investors looking beyond meme-driven rallies, the choice of which crypto to buy before 2026 hits is clear.

        "BODY": "As the crypto market kicks into high gear, all attention is turning to emerging players that could shape the next bullish wave, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rapidly stealing the spotlight. The DeFi coin is in presale level 6 is $0.035. In stage 7, it will go up by 14.29% to $0.04. Members who join this phase will be earning at least 400% returns once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has already surpassed $14.83 million and more than 15700 investors. While established giants like Ethereum (ETH) continue to anchor the charts, Mutuum Finance’s innovative approach to decentralized lending has positioned it as one of the most talked-about projects in the current pump. Ethereum (ETH): Market Status Ethereum is currently trading at approximately $4,714, showing moderate intraday fluctuations between a low near $4,210 and a high around $4,879 . Its recent surge, spurred by dovish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve, helped it reach new all-time highs in the $4,800–$4,900 range. Despite cooling off as profit-taking set in, analysts note that Ethereum remains well-supported near its $4,100–$4,200 levels, reflecting resilient demand and balanced technical indicators. Institutional engagement continues to rise, prompting major banks like Standard Chartered to lift their year-end forecasts and endorse Ethereum’s growing significance in stablecoin infrastructure. The platform’s strengthening on-chain fundamentals, ranging from rising fee activity to expanding total value locked, further support its position amid broader crypto momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Two-Tier DeFi Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative non-custodial decentralized DeFi protocol. The protocol is capable of Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending at high operating efficiency and flexibility. Peer-to-Contract utilizes the smart contract feature to lend with reduced or no human interference. Peer-to-Peer eliminates intermediaries and has lenders and borrowers directly transacting with each other. The model is highly easy to manage risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring with the presale being the center of attraction. It is holding stage 6 at $0.035. It will also rise to 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage. Investor demand is growing with the project already at over $14.83 million and already possessing a token holder community of over 15700. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching its new overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. With a well-built and enduring foundation that will persist even with solutions failure for decades, the stablecoin stands very high chances of being safe and stable for many years to come. The project also boasts a 95.0 trust score as presented by Certik. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a reward of $50,000 USDT. It has four severity levels to be resolved that are critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway because it is willing to expand its community. 10 lucky giveaway participants will get a chance to win MUTM tokens worth $10,000. A Strategy for Sustainable Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has structured its tokenomics architecture to create long-term value with maximum liquidity and protection against inflation. The token’s long-term growth results from a controlled process of distribution during presale backed by robust management systems. Long-term deflationary mechanisms are initiated to decrease network supply responsible for scarcity in an attempt to provide space for long-term appreciation in price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $14.83 million and attracted more than 15,700 investors, now in presale stage 6 at $0.035. Stage 7 will see a 14.29% increase to $0.04, offering early buyers a clear path to at least 400% returns on launch. Backed by a 95/100 CertiK trust score, a $100,000 giveaway, and a dual lending model for both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer transactions, MUTM is positioned for significant growth.

        "BODY": "In the wake of Cointelegraph's recent analysis, \"Time for a Web3 reality check: Which altcoin sectors are really delivering?\" (published August 18, 2025), the Web3 ecosystem is undergoing a critical self-assessment. The article highlights a stabilization in daily active wallets at around 24 million, a shift in on-chain activity where gaming dominates at over 20% while DeFi dips below 19%, and a surge in \"other\" categories like AI, RWA, and DePIN capturing 58% of gas usage. Social DApps, including SocialFi projects, are noted as rising stars amid this transition, with AI integrations driving user engagement. Against this backdrop, UXLINK emerges as a compelling case study in the SocialFi sector—a project blending social infrastructure with AI to bridge Web2 familiarity and Web3 utility. This analysis evaluates UXLINK's performance, adoption metrics, and alignment with broader trends, assessing whether it truly \"delivers\" in a maturing market. Project Overview and Positioning UXLINK positions itself as a \"social growth layer\" for Web3, aiming to lower adoption barriers through simplified onboarding, decentralized identity management, and AI-powered networking. Launched with a focus on Telegram-based mini-apps, it enables users to build verifiable, two-way social connections that translate into on-chain value. Unlike traditional social platforms, UXLINK emphasizes real-world relationships over superficial follows, turning social graphs into composable assets for DApps, communities, and projects. Key features include: AI-Driven Matching: Algorithms connect users to relevant DApps, communities, and opportunities, enhancing discovery without centralized gatekeepers. Decentralized Infrastructure: Users own their data and identities, with one ID granting access across multiple chains and applications. SocialFi Utilities: Integrates referral systems, token airdrops, and PayFi for real-world payments via debit cards linked to Web3 tokens. Ecosystem Expansion: Supports over 600 integrated communities and is evolving toward multi-chain compatibility, stronger security, and global localization. As of mid-2025, UXLINK boasts over 54 million users, positioning it as a key infrastructure for onboarding the \"next billion\" into Web3 by making interactions feel as intuitive as Web2 social media. Adoption and On-Chain Activity: Aligning with Rising Social Trends The Cointelegraph piece underscores a pivot toward social and AI DApps, with these sectors gaining traction amid DeFi's relative decline. UXLINK exemplifies this shift, leveraging its social graph to drive organic growth. Daily active users have shown steady increases, particularly through Telegram integrations that reduce friction for non-crypto natives. In Q2 2025, while overall Web3 wallets stabilized at 24 million, UXLINK's user base contributed to the social DApp surge by facilitating verifiable connections—such as wallet-native ties and intent-aware edges—that enhance engagement without relying on farmed metrics. Gas usage data from the article reveals \"other\" categories (including AI-infused social tools) dominating at 58%, a trend UXLINK taps into via its on-chain social interactions. For instance, features like AI-powered recommendations and decentralized attestations generate meaningful gas-consuming activities, such as verifying relationships or executing cross-DApp links. This positions UXLINK not as a mere feed but as a primitive layer for trust-at-scale, where connections become portable assets rather than platform-locked inventory. Community feedback on X highlights UXLINK's real-world impact: Posts emphasize its role in creating \"authentic audiences\" for projects, with organic growth stemming from two-way relationships rather than inflated follows. Partnerships with entities like OKX and backing from Web3 players further amplify adoption, enabling scalable tools for user acquisition and retention. Price Performance and Market Delivery The article's price analysis shows mixed results across sectors: smart contract platforms up 142%, DeFi at 77%, but AI tokens down 25%. UXLINK's $UXLINK token, celebrating its one-year TGE anniversary on July 18, 2025, has bucked some downward trends, trading above its initial listing price amid broader market volatility. Technical indicators suggest a surge driven by partnerships and innovations, with forecasts projecting an average price of $0.4467 by year-end 2025. However, like many AI-adjacent tokens, UXLINK faces headwinds from sector-wide dips. Its delivery shines in utility rather than speculation: The token powers governance, staking for social rewards, and PayFi integrations expanding into 2025-2026. This aligns with the article's call for \"reality checks\" on sectors delivering tangible value—UXLINK's focus on monetizable social graphs and on-chain growth engines positions it as a performer in SocialFi, where user-owned networks drive sustainable economics. Challenges and Future Outlook Despite strengths, UXLINK must address sybil resistance and privacy in its ZK attestations to maintain trust, as noted in community discussions. Regulatory hurdles in social data handling could also pose risks, mirroring broader Web3 concerns. Looking ahead, UXLINK's roadmap—enhancing AI models, security, and global features—poses it for leadership in Web3's social layer. In a reality-checked ecosystem, UXLINK delivers by prioritizing verifiable, user-centric connections over hype, potentially catalyzing the mainstream shift the article envisions. As SocialFi evolves, projects like this could redefine what \"delivering\" means: not just metrics, but meaningful, scalable utility.

        "BODY": "The crypto market often shifts between excitement and uncertainty, with headlines about a crypto crash or questions about why crypto is down dominating news cycles. Yet, smart investors understand that the next bull run is shaped by today’s decisions. While Cardano (ADA) rewarded long-term believers through patience and solid fundamentals, a new DeFi contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is shaping up as the project that could outperform ADA’s growth trajectory in the years ahead. With its stablecoin innovation, staking rewards, and revenue-backed buy-and-distribute model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a utility-driven investment designed for durability, not just hype. Stable utility meets real market demand Whale accumulation trends suggest that experienced investors often look for assets with long-term utility. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart. At its core, the protocol is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity system where lenders, borrowers, and liquidators interact seamlessly. Borrowers will be able to unlock liquidity without selling their assets, while lenders will earn passive yields, and liquidators will keep the system balanced. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds a breakthrough layer with its decentralized stablecoin, pegged to $1, which will only be minted against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will oversee interest rates to keep the stablecoin near its peg, while arbitrage ensures natural price stability. This is not speculation—it is a revenue-backed financial tool that strengthens the ecosystem and adds to the token’s utility. Staking further increases value by rewarding users of mtTokens, which represent deposits into liquidity pools. Rewards will be funded through revenue buybacks of MUTM from the open market, creating constant demand pressure. These mechanics mean that every interaction with the platform—from lending and borrowing to staking—adds sustainable demand for the native token. This future-focused design places MUTM ahead of many altcoins in terms of practical use cases. Roadmap to mass adoption Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growth strategy is carefully laid out across four roadmap phases. The second phase has centered on the development of smart contracts, risk parameters, and user-facing applications. Phase three will bring beta testing, audits, and functional demos, opening the door for early community access. The most exciting developments arrive in phase four, which will launch the platform live, prepare exchange listings, and set the stage for multi-chain expansion. This roadmap is not just about ticking boxes—it is a blueprint for scaling into a DeFi giant. In the middle of this structured growth, the presale has been gaining momentum. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $14.83 million at a token price of $0.035, with 25% of the tokens already sold and more than 15,650 holders on board. The next price jump is set at $0.04, meaning every entry now comes at a discount compared to what’s coming. Early investors have already seen significant returns: someone who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 is sitting on 3.5x gains on paper before the token has even listed. By contrast, ADA holders had to wait years for similar growth, underscoring how rapid MUTM’s presale momentum is. Trust in the project is reinforced through strong security measures. A CertiK audit has already awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, while a $50,000 bug bounty program ensures constant protection through severity-based rewards. On top of this, a $100,000 giveaway spread across 10 winners keeps the community engaged and growing. As crypto prices today fluctuate and markets test investor conviction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been building quietly and strategically, demonstrating why this presale is attracting such attention. The case for 100x in the next cycle When evaluating a crypto investment, long-term projections matter more than short-term noise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning its growth with major adoption drivers: Layer 2 expansion, exchange listings on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, and steady revenue-driven buybacks that support price appreciation. These factors build consistent buy-side pressure and incentivize long-term holding, the very mechanics that can fuel exponential gains. Analysts projecting MUTM’s growth into 2025 and 2026 highlight how the combination of presale momentum, exchange listings, and real-world demand for lending and borrowing can set the stage for a 100x trajectory. ADA achieved its success by proving real utility and rewarding patience, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to follow a similar yet faster path. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents an opportunity to secure a position in a project with practical utility, audited trust signals, and a roadmap aligned with future adoption. Missing this entry before the presale price climbs again would mean watching from the sidelines as others enjoy the kind of exponential returns that every crypto investor seeks.

        "BODY": "More than 10,000 South Korean crypto investors now hold digital assets exceeding 1 billion won ($750,000) across domestic exchanges, with young investors in their 20s maintaining the highest average holdings despite representing the smallest demographic group. According to the Korean Times , the data showed that one in five Koreans actively trades cryptocurrencies. Young Investors Lead Holdings With Smallest Numbers Financial Supervisory Service data submitted to lawmakers reveals 10,810 users across Korea’s five major exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX, each held assets surpassing the 1 billion won threshold as of August 5. These crypto millionaires maintain average balances of 2.23 billion won, approximately 217 times the overall user average of 10.27 million won. The demographic breakdown reveals that investors in their 50s dominate by numbers, with 3,994 individuals, followed by those in their 40s with 3,086 participants. Source: YNA However, despite comprising only 137 individuals, investors in their 20s lead by average holdings at 2.69 billion won per person, surpassing all other age groups significantly. Korea’s total crypto trading population has reached 10.86 million active accounts capable of trading, representing roughly 20% of the nation’s 51.7 million population. Collectively, these users hold digital assets worth 111.6 trillion won, with Upbit commanding 76% of millionaire investors despite holding 52% market share across the top five exchanges. Government Fast-Tracks Pro-Business Crypto Reforms President Lee Jae-myung’s administration has designated crypto market development as a “key national task” within its five-year state administration plan, prioritizing stablecoin regulations and institutional trading reforms. The Presidential Committee on State Affairs identified “construction of a digital asset ecosystem” among 123 critical government objectives, signaling unprecedented regulatory support. In fact, in July, the government is already moving to reclassify crypto trading firms as “venture companies,” granting access to tax incentives, subsidies, and state-backed financing previously denied since 2018. South Korea is moving to reclassify crypto firms as “venture companies,” which would grant access to government subsidies. #SouthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/FucfcydMDq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 The Ministry of SMEs and Startups proposed amendments to include Virtual Asset Service Providers under venture company status, potentially reversing policies that previously categorized crypto firms alongside gambling venues. Financial regulators have lifted restrictions on institutional crypto investments while preparing to approve Korea’s first spot cryptocurrency ETFs. The Financial Services Commission presented implementation measures for spot crypto ETFs and regulatory frameworks for won-based stablecoins scheduled for the second half of 2025. Major financial institutions have filed numerous stablecoin trademark applications following Lee’s campaign promises to launch Korean won-pegged digital currencies for business and international trade. Leading banks and IT companies are developing crypto-related business plans, anticipating opportunities in advanced payment platforms. However, regulatory crackdowns continue in specific areas. The Financial Services Commission suspended all crypto lending services after 27,600 investors borrowed 1.5 trillion won in the first month, with 13% facing forced liquidations due to market volatility. Young Investors Drive Adoption Despite Regulatory Uncertainties According to a recent report from Cryptonew, Korean investors in their 20s and 30s increasingly favor crypto investments over traditional U.S. tech stocks , with crypto-related equity investments rising from 8.5% in January to 36.5% in June before declining to 31.4% in July. The Korean Center for International Finance attributed this shift to expanding stablecoin opportunities following the U.S. GENIUS Act passage . US President Donald Trump displays the GENIUS Act after signing. Source: LiveNowFox Retail investment in U.S. big tech shares dropped from a monthly average of $1.68 billion between January and April to just $260 million in July. Younger demographics allocated an average of 14% of their financial assets to cryptocurrencies, with over half of South Koreans aged 20-59 having crypto trading experience. Similarly, survey data from June indicates that 27% of respondents currently hold cryptocurrencies, with average holdings reaching 13 million won ($9,547) per investor. Early adopters typically began with Bitcoin before diversifying into altcoins and stablecoins as experience increased, with 60% starting investments during the 2020 bull run. While adoption is growing in the country, tax authorities have also intensified crypto asset seizures from tax evaders, with Jeju City recently completing investigations of 2,962 residents and seizing 230 million won worth of cryptocurrencies from 49 individuals. Seoul’s Gangnam District recovered over $144,000 through similar enforcement actions, using AI-powered tools to identify hidden crypto assets. Crypto taxation remains suspended until January 2027, creating a grace period during which capital gains taxes are not imposed. Political leaders warn that the Democratic Party may enforce virtual asset taxation starting in 2027 to secure tax revenue amid expansionary fiscal policies.

It has a strong team and further partnerships. The technology is sound, and they are constantly improving it. The mainnet is live, and they are working on adoption. The price is forecasted to increase in the next years. So far, the IoTeX network’s potential is immense. Due to its capabilities, we’ll likely see more IoT devices and DApps created on the network, influencing IOTX’s overall price. The token’s price is expected to increase to $0.13864 by the end of 2028. Why is IOTX down? Iotex (IOTX) is down due to low buyers’ support amidst neutral market sentiment, indicated by moderate scores of technical indicators like the RSI and downward trends in moving averages. Will IOTX reach $0.100? According to the 2027 IOTX price predictions, IOTX is expected to reach an average price of $0.110, suggesting it may approach above the said level, consistently reaching the $0.100 mark throughout the year even on the lower side. However, in the best-case scenario, IOTX Coin might surpass $0.109757. Will IOTX reach $0.200? The 2031 forecast anticipates a peak price of $0.22529, indicating that IOTX could surpass the $0.20 mark during that year, assuming the bullish momentum and positive market conditions persist. Will IOTX reach $1? The prediction suggests a maximum price of one-fourth of $1 for IOTX by 2031, indicating the cryptocurrency will not reach this mark in the next five years. However, this would depend on sustained growth, market dynamics, and broader adoption factors. Does IOTX have a good long-term future? The long-term price predictions from 2025 to 2031 indicate a generally positive outlook for the IOTX token, with projected growth in average and maximum prices over the years. This suggests potential for IOTX to establish itself as a valuable asset in the cryptocurrency market, subject to market developments and adoption trends. The token will increase by almost 484% in the next five years. Recent news/opinions on IOTX IoTeX announced that it is now live on FUTU.

        "BODY": "Dubai, UAE, August 25th, 2025, Chainwire Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released its latest Crypto Insights Report on Ethereum (ETH) , outlining the key levels, catalysts, and institutional trends shaping the asset’s outlook. ETH is currently trading around $4,218, consolidating after a rally that pushed it within reach of its all-time high of $4,867. With a 63% year-to-date return, Ethereum continues to outperform broader markets, raising the question: what’s next for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap? Key Highlights Critical resistance at $4,867 — breaking this ATH zone would mark a renewed bullish phase. $5,000–$5,500 target zone — a psychological milestone, supported by ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and network upgrades. Medium-term projections — $6,700 to $10,000 depending on ETH/BTC performance and macro conditions. Institutional demand surging — declining exchange reserves signal a potential supply squeeze. The report identifies $5,000 as the next major resistance level for ETH, emphasizing its dual importance as both a technical barrier and psychological milestone. Historically, Ethereum has required multiple attempts to clear each round-number threshold, with successful breakouts often triggering fresh waves of momentum. If ETH can decisively push through $5,000, analysts see the potential for a rally toward $5,500 and beyond, particularly if ETF inflows remain strong and network fundamentals continue to strengthen. Looking further ahead, Ethereum’s on-chain indicators and ETH/BTC strength point to sustained upside potential. The MVRV ratio has rebounded from early-year lows, suggesting ETH is entering a more bullish phase. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC ratio has nearly doubled from cycle lows, signaling renewed dominance against Bitcoin. Should ETH revisit historical highs in this ratio, its price could target the $10,000 mark, assuming a supportive macro backdrop and steady Bitcoin performance. Underlying these technical and on-chain signals is a growing wave of institutional accumulation. Corporates such as Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming have accelerated ETH purchases during market dips, contributing to the steady decline of exchange reserves. With more ETH locked into staking, treasuries, and long-term custody, the available supply on centralized exchanges continues to shrink. This supply-side squeeze not only reinforces Ethereum’s position as a strategic asset but also heightens the potential for sharp price movements during demand surges. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

        "BODY": "In a market where meme coins like SHIB and DOGE have already delivered their biggest runs, investors are shifting their gaze to projects that combine affordability with true utility. One project gaining outsized attention from whales is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Trading at just $0.035 in its ongoing presale, MUTM stands out as the best crypto to buy under $1 in 2025 thanks to its innovative DeFi model, whale accumulation, and clear roadmap that blends trust with growth. Utility-driven disruption in DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not chasing short-term hype but instead bringing practical innovation to decentralized finance. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow users to borrow directly from liquidity pools, creating seamless access to funds with interest rates automatically adjusted based on pool utilization. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will give borrowers and lenders the freedom to set their own terms, offering flexibility that centralized platforms fail to provide. This two-track approach ensures the protocol will serve both traditional DeFi users and those seeking more personalized lending agreements. To strengthen stability in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a consistent $1 peg. It will only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized assets and burned when loans are repaid, supported by governance-adjusted interest rates to keep it balanced. This means that while crypto prices today still swing wildly, users will benefit from a stable asset designed to weather volatility. Whales are now showing strong interest in the project because its mechanics go far beyond speculative trading. With staking of mtTokens—interest-bearing assets users receive for deposits—paired with a buyback-and-distribute system, MUTM creates constant market demand. Revenue from the platform will be used to purchase MUTM on the open market and reward stakers, aligning long-term incentives with the project’s growth trajectory. For large investors who typically look past hype cycles, this is an ecosystem designed to sustain itself even during a crypto crash. Presale momentum, whale accumulation, and roadmap ahead The presale journey of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows accelerating momentum. The project is in Phase 6 at $0.035, having already raised over $14.83 million with 25% of tokens sold to a community now exceeding 15,650 holders. Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.04, locking in an immediate 15% jump for those who enter before the phase closes. For investors diversifying out of meme coins, this is already showing attractive results. An investor who rebalanced from SHIB and DOGE into Phase 2 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 would already sit on gains of 2.3x—before the listing even happens at $0.06. That’s a level of pre-market ROI that meme coins can no longer promise. This kind of growth has caught the attention of whales who recognize the strength of future catalysts. The roadmap is clear: the project will move from finalizing its core development to a beta launch of its platform, before expanding to Layer 2 networks for scale. Exchange listings on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase are also anticipated, opening the door for mass adoption once the presale concludes. Trust has been reinforced through Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s (MUTM) CertiK audit, scoring 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet, ensuring a strong security foundation. To go further, the team has put up a $50,000 bug bounty with severity-based rewards, including payouts up to $2,000, encouraging the community to stress-test the system. At the same time, a $100,000 giveaway has been launched for 10 winners, fueling excitement around participation. These layers of trust and opportunity explain why whales are quietly building their positions. They are not waiting for retail to catch on. Their strategy has always been to accumulate assets that offer reliable long-term incentives, and with MUTM’s buyback-driven staking rewards, this is one of the few tokens under $1 offering sustainability alongside growth. Final words For retail investors questioning why crypto is down and where the next breakout will happen, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives a clear answer. Unlike meme-driven rallies that fade, this project is built on mechanisms designed to reward participants continuously, regardless of market cycles. With heavy whale accumulation already underway, presale momentum accelerating, and utilities that stand above hype, the window to secure MUTM under $1 is narrowing. Meme coins delivered entertainment and short-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering real decentralized lending innovation, trust through audits, and long-term incentives backed by whale accumulation. As Ethereum (ETH) prepares for another record-breaking rally, the smarter crypto investment under $1 is happening right now in the presale stages of MUTM. Waiting means missing the price jump in Phase 7—and possibly the wave of retail investors that whales are already preparing for.

This platform has a professional analyst and IT team that can analyze your mining rig’s hashrate and promptly update it with the latest rigs to ensure the highest returns. If you’re looking to capitalize on investment opportunities, now is the perfect time to join cloud mining.

Once your account balance reaches $150, you can withdraw to your wallet or purchase more contracts. What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining is the process of verifying transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain through a cloud mining service provider to receive new Dogecoin rewards. Although it looks simple, it is actually quite complex. In cloud mining, the service provider uses multiple computers to process the same batch of transactions simultaneously, but only one computer receives the new Dogecoin rewards. These new coins are earned by appending new transaction blocks to old ones, which requires solving a complex mathematical equation. The first node to solve this equation wins and gets to add the newly confirmed transaction block to the blockchain. Dogecoin Mining Features Dogecoin mining differs from other cryptocurrencies in several key ways, including: Algorithm: Each cryptocurrency has a unique set of mining rules, called a mining algorithm or hashing algorithm. Block time: This is the average time it takes to check a new transaction block and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This number indicates the difficulty of mining new coins and fluctuates based on the number of miners. Reward: The amount of new coins awarded to a miner with each new block.

        "BODY": "Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire behind Tron, has served as the prime minister of the self-proclaimed micronation Liberland since 2024, having been reelected multiple times in quarterly votes. Key Takeaways: Crypto mogul Justin Sun has become the prime minister of Liberland, a self-proclaimed micronation. Liberland has relied on crypto donors and experiments with tokens and blockchain governance. Sun’s close ties to Donald Trump and his family could help Liberland push for U.S. recognition and greater global legitimacy. The Free Republic of Liberland, founded in 2015 on a disputed patch of land between Croatia and Serbia, has long sought international recognition. With Sun now in its top political role, the project is hoping for a breakthrough, according to a Wired report . Czech Politician Plants Flag, Founds Liberland Liberland was created by Czech politician Vít Jedlička, who planted a flag on a Danube riverbank after concluding that European democracies were mired in regulation and overtaxation. The territory, unclaimed due to a border dispute, has been repeatedly blocked by Croatian authorities, who dismiss the effort as “a fictitious project of a handful of adventurers.” Settlers have faced police evictions more than two dozen times, and the land remains largely undeveloped. Despite these obstacles, Liberland has built a following in libertarian and crypto circles. Wealthy digital asset donors have kept the project alive, funding experiments such as the launch of two native tokens, a blockchain voting system, and even a national blockchain. Sun was first elected prime minister in October and has since been reelected three times in quarterly votes. Sun has compared Liberland to the Vatican, calling it a symbolic center for the libertarian movement. “Libertarians everywhere may have their own countries and nationalities, but Liberland will serve as their ideological homeland,” he wrote on X after his election. Many friends have recently asked me about my involvement with @Liberland_org , and I am indeed very happy to see the community elect me as the Prime Minister of Liberland. My understanding of Liberland is as follows: Liberland is not just a country; it is a manifestation of a… — H.E. Justin Sun (Astronaut Version) (@justinsuntron) October 11, 2024 President Jedlička argues Sun’s involvement brings credibility: “We are taken more seriously when we have a person like Justin Sun on board.” Sun Has Close Ties With Donald Trump The Tron founder has close ties to former U.S. president Donald Trump and his family. He has invested tens of millions in Trump-linked crypto projects such as World Liberty Financial, appeared at Trump’s golf club events, and been referred to as a “great friend” by Eric Trump. Sun has hinted he plans to leverage these connections to push for U.S. recognition of Liberland, reasoning that other countries would follow Washington’s lead. Jedlička has suggested Sun has already spent time in the White House. “In general, his task is to help us get Liberland recognized and up and running,” he said, adding that the effort is being taken “seriously.” Liberland continues to mix serious ambition with eccentric projects. After Sun’s sub-orbital flight with Blue Origin in August, the government announced plans to plant its flag on an asteroid in partnership with space startup LifeShip. Meanwhile, settlers on the ground have managed to build a treehouse and a beach bar after months without interference from Croatian police. Earlier this month, Liberland’s delegation attended former U.S. congressman Ron Paul’s 90th birthday, where the country was listed as an “official partner.” Jedlička later claimed ties with the Trump administration were strengthening. For now, Liberland remains a small patch of riverfront forest with a dozen settlers, but with Justin Sun as its prime minister, it is once again pushing for relevance on the global stage.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Astounding Bitcoin Whale Profit: $39.36M Secured from ETH Long The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of an incredible Bitcoin whale profit ! A long-dormant investor, who strategically swapped their Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH) years ago, recently closed out a significant portion of their ETH long positions. This move resulted in a staggering $39.36 million in realized gains, as reported by prominent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa. This story is a compelling example of how patience and strategic market moves can lead to immense success in the volatile crypto landscape. Decoding the Astounding Bitcoin Whale Profit This particular whale, a significant market player, had been inactive for an impressive seven years. Their re-emergence to make such a calculated and profitable move has captured the attention of investors worldwide. The investor strategically spread their Ethereum long positions across five different digital addresses. By expertly closing two of these positions, they successfully locked in tens of millions of dollars, transforming potential gains into concrete wealth. This event isn’t just a fascinating anecdote; it’s a powerful demonstration of the immense potential for wealth creation within the crypto market. It highlights the critical role of long-term vision and the ability to identify and act upon opportune moments. Furthermore, it underscores the invaluable insights provided by diligent on-chain analysis, which allows us to track such significant market shifts. What Was the Strategy Behind This Massive Bitcoin Whale Profit? The core strategy employed by this whale was remarkably simple, yet profoundly effective: convert existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and maintain these positions for an extended period. This long-term “hodling” approach allowed the investor to fully capitalize on Ethereum’s impressive price appreciation over several years. It’s a classic example of buying low and selling high, but on an epic scale. Initial Strategic Conversion: The whale made a decisive move to convert a substantial amount of their Bitcoin into Ethereum, betting on ETH’s future growth. Patient Long-Term Hold: They demonstrated remarkable patience, holding these ETH positions for a significant duration, allowing the market to mature and values to climb. Timely and Strategic Exit: When market conditions were favorable, they executed a partial closure of their long positions, skillfully securing their impressive profit. Such patience and strategic foresight are often distinguishing characteristics of successful whale-level trading, setting these large investors apart from those focused on short-term fluctuations. What Insights Can We Gain from This Bitcoin Whale’s Actions? While the actions of a single whale might seem isolated, they frequently offer valuable clues about broader market sentiment and potential trends. When a large holder like this realizes such substantial profits, it can send several signals to the market: Firstly, it might suggest that the whale perceives current market conditions as opportune for taking some profits off the table, perhaps anticipating a period of consolidation or a slight pullback. Secondly, the fact that the whale still maintains a significant portion of their holdings demonstrates continued conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value and future prospects. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa specifically noted that this whale still holds approximately 40,000 ETH in long positions. These remaining holdings are distributed across three addresses on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid (HYPE), representing about $11.17 million in unrealized gains. This continued holding reinforces their belief in ETH’s ongoing potential. How Can You Learn from This Bitcoin Whale Profit Story? It’s true that not everyone operates with the capital scale of a crypto whale, but there are universally applicable lessons to be learned from this extraordinary story: Embrace Long-Term Vision: Patience is not just a virtue; it’s a powerful strategy in volatile markets. Identifying strong assets and holding them through market cycles can yield substantial rewards. Consider Diversification: The initial swap from BTC to ETH illustrates a willingness to adapt and strategically diversify within the dynamic crypto ecosystem. Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. Master Strategic Exits: Knowing precisely when to take profits is as crucial as knowing when to enter a position. Securing gains prevents them from evaporating in market downturns. Utilize On-Chain Data: While complex, insights from on-chain analysis can provide an edge, helping you understand the moves of significant market participants. Understanding the movements of these large holders, often termed “whales,” can indeed offer a glimpse into potential market trends. However, always remember the golden rule: conduct your own thorough research and consult with financial professionals before making any investment decisions. The crypto market is inherently risky, and past performance is not indicative of future results. In conclusion, the recent realization of an astounding $39.36 million Bitcoin whale profit from Ethereum long positions stands as a powerful testament to strategic, long-term investing in the cryptocurrency space. This whale’s journey, from a dormant Bitcoin holder to a substantial Ethereum profit-taker, offers a fascinating and instructive case study. It vividly highlights the potential for significant returns when patience, precise timing, and a deep understanding of market dynamics converge. As this astute investor continues to hold a considerable ETH position, the broader crypto community watches with keen interest, eager to see what their next move might be.

        "BODY": "Bitcoin CEO and Trump crypto policy adviser David Bailey declared there will be no Bitcoin bear market for several years, citing massive institutional adoption even as Bitcoin trades near its August bottom of $112,000. Bailey argued that sovereigns, banks, insurers, corporates, and pension funds will drive continuous buying pressure, claiming the market hasn’t captured even 0.01% of the total addressable market. The bold prediction comes as Bitcoin struggles with price momentum despite reaching a new all-time high of $124,000 on August 13. The crypto currently trades around $112,000, representing a 10% decline from its peak and marking what analysts consider a concerning August bottom amid broader altcoin strength. There’s not going to be another Bitcoin bear market for several years. Every Sovereign, Bank, Insurer, Corporate, Pension, and more will own Bitcoin. The process has already begun in earnest, yet we haven’t even captured 0.01% of the TAM. We’re going so much higher. Dream big — David Bailey $1.0mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) August 23, 2025 Bailey’s comments sparked debate among crypto veterans, with some questioning why Bitcoin declined during a raging bull equity market if institutional demand remains so robust. Critics noted that Bitcoin treasury companies face mounting pressure, with nearly a quarter trading below net asset value as market conditions tighten. Institutional Appetite Contrasts With Technical Weakness Bailey defended Bitcoin’s recent weakness by attributing price pressure to futures and options manipulation rather than fundamental demand shifts. He maintained that growing institutional adoption represents the first genuine institutional buy-in Bitcoin has experienced, distinguishing current conditions from previous cycles driven primarily by retail speculation. Corporate Bitcoin holdings have exploded to over $215 billion, with close to 300 entities, with public companies controlling 71.4% of total institutional reserves. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries MicroStrategy leads with over 629K BTC, followed by MARA Holdings at over 50K BTC. However, new research from Sentora warns that this corporate Bitcoin experiment faces structural risks during credit cycle downturns. The study characterizes most strategies as “negative-carry trades” where companies borrow fiat to acquire non-yielding assets, creating dangerous dependencies on continued Bitcoin appreciation. Mining companies face particular vulnerability with razor-thin margins, often becoming structurally unprofitable below $100,000 Bitcoin prices. Marathon Digital and similar firms maintain Bitcoin exposure representing 50-80% of their total assets, creating high liquidation risks during market downturns. VanEck Maintains $180K Target as Opinion Leaders Rally Behind Bull Case Investment firm VanEck has recently reaffirmed its $180,000 year-end Bitcoin price target despite recent volatility, with CME basis funding rates surging to 9% – the highest level since February 2025. The firm’s research indicates institutional demand remains robust, with exchange-traded products purchasing 54,000 BTC and Digital Asset Treasuries adding 72,000 BTC in July alone. VanEck maintains $180K Bitcoin forecast as CME basis rates hit 9% peak driven by institutional demand. #Bitcoin #BullRun https://t.co/ZsXmtpIvbU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 24, 2025 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also predicted Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 . Armstrong cited regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key drivers for the ambitious target, noting many large funds currently hold about 1% Bitcoin allocations with room for significant expansion. Similarly, Copper’s head of research, Fadi Aboualfa, suggested Bitcoin appears “primed for another significant leg upward” but cautioned that institutional-driven markets may follow a “more tempered path” compared to previous retail-fueled cycles. Aboualfa projected Bitcoin could breach $140,000 in September and reach $150,000 by early October. However, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz provided a contrarian perspective, warning that million-dollar Bitcoin predictions would likely reflect U.S. economic collapse rather than crypto success. Novogratz argued he would prefer lower Bitcoin prices in a stable economy over extreme valuations driven by a currency crisis. Cycle Debate Intensifies as Altcoins Outperform Bitcoin Bailey’s no-bear-market thesis contradicts Glassnode analysis , suggesting Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycles remain structurally intact despite institutional integration. The blockchain analytics firm found that current cycle duration and long-term holder profit-taking levels closely mirror previous patterns. Glassnode data indicates Bitcoin’s current cycle has maintained supply above profitable levels for 273 days, making it the second-longest duration on record behind the 2015-2018 cycle’s 335 days. Source: Glassnode Capital inflows weakened despite new all-time highs, with realized cap increases reaching only 6% monthly compared to 13% during the initial $100,000 breakout. Derivatives markets continue exhibiting elevated risk appetite characteristic of mature bull phases, with Bitcoin futures open interest maintaining $67 billion levels. Ethereum’s derivatives dominance also reached critical levels, with perpetual futures volume hitting an all-time high of 67% versus Bitcoin markets. The altcoin surge contrasts sharply with Bitcoin’s August weakness. Ethereum reached a historic all-time high of around $5,000 with projections toward $6,900, while BNB hit new peaks near $900, driven by ecosystem developments and token burning mechanics. Notably, early Bitcoin whales have begun rotating assets, with one holder moving 400 BTC worth $45.5 million into leveraged Ethereum positions, and another sold 24,000 BTC just a few hours ago.

        "BODY": "While Ethereum has historically led advancements in the blockchain sector, its latest ETF buzz has been shadowed by regulatory hesitations, stalling the anticipated influx of institutional funds. Despite trading highs above $3,400, the waning excitement could signify a shift in the market dynamics. Simultaneously, the emergence of Bitcoin Swift, which has gathered over $1,000,000 and rallied more than 4,000 community enthusiasts, underscores a pivotal moment in the crypto landscape with its pre-launch excitement slated for August 30. Dissecting Bitcoin Swift's Innovative Edge Amid the current crypto discourse, Bitcoin Swift has introduced a novel Proof of Yield (PoY) staking rewards model. This model ensures immediate returns to early backers, setting a precedent that contrasts sharply with speculative investment tendencies. This approach is triggering a significant shift in investor interest, potentially positioning BTC3 as a frontrunner in the 2025 market predictions. Technological Superiority and Market Readiness Bitcoin Swift isn't merely a cryptocurrency but a decentralized financial system integrating advanced blockchain technologies such as AI smart contracts and zk identity proofs. These features, combined with a hybrid consensus model, enhance privacy, governance, and compliance—facets crucial for widespread adoption. Bitcoin Swift's transition to Solana ensures rapid transaction capabilities, a strategic move to facilitate scalability. Endorsements through rigorous audits like the Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Spywolf audits, further catalyze trust and transparency in its presale process. A Future-Ready Crypto Presale: Stage 6 Analysis The ongoing Stage 6 of the presale showcases a remarkable 166% APY and a token pricing set to escalate market enthusiasm. With the presale nearing its completion, investors are rapidly capitalizing on the high-yield opportunities present before the official market launch on August 30. Moreover, the presale incentivizes participation through a tiered bonus system rewarding substantial token bonuses for higher investments, enhancing the attractiveness for both small and large investors. Concluding Thoughts: A Paradigm Shift in Crypto Investments The fading allure of Ethereum's ETF contrasts starkly with the dynamic surge of Bitcoin Swift. This new player is not only reshaping investment flows but also setting new standards in crypto economics with its early payouts and robust technological framework. As the market anticipates its next movements, Bitcoin Swift is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends.

        "BODY": "Ethereum has been riding high on the ETF headlines, trading above $3,400 as investors hoped for fresh inflows of institutional capital. Yet the excitement has started to cool as regulators drag their feet, leaving traders wondering if the momentum has already passed. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Swift has exploded onto the scene, raising over $1,000,000 with more than 4,000 community members onboard and officially announcing an early launch for August 30. Even better, the team has introduced bonus rewards for all presale participants right now. With so much activity packed into just a few weeks, it is no wonder that BTC3 is breaking momentum charts while others are losing steam. Ethereum vs Bitcoin Swift: the shift is happening Ethereum’s network remains the hub of decentralized applications and liquidity, and the ETF news still keeps it in the spotlight. But its scaling challenges and higher fees are leaving room for disruption. Bitcoin Swift is stepping in with a new kind of programmable staking rewards model called Proof of Yield. PoY is already delivering payouts to presale participants from day one, giving investors a reason to get excited beyond speculation. That kind of instant return is why analysts are pointing to BTC3 as a top contender for 2025. Bitcoin Swift: built for speed and security BTC3 is not just a token . It is designed as a decentralized financial operating system that integrates PoY, AI smart contracts, zk identity, and a hybrid consensus model for unmatched security. Privacy is protected with zk proofs, governance is enhanced by quadratic voting and AI screening, and compliance is reinforced through MPC audits. Even better, BTC3 will launch on Solana first to guarantee ultra fast transactions at less than $0.01 per swap before bridging to its own chain in 2026. This is why the project has already secured recognition through the Cyberscope Audit , the Solidproof Audit , and the Spywolf Audit . Add in the verified KYC , and you get one of the most transparent presale projects available. Stage 6 Presale: urgency and upside Stage 6 is live , and the performance is already stunning. Stage 5 closed with a 96% APY, and $110,000 had already been distributed to participants. Now Stage 6 offers a token price of $6 and a doubled APY of 166%. With demand outpacing expectations, the team has confirmed an early launch on August 30, leaving only Stages 6 and 7 before trading begins. The community now exceeds 4,000 members, and funds raised stand at over $1 million. Alongside PoY rewards at the end of each stage, a massive Bonus Event is underway:• $100–$1,999 → 25% bonus tokens• $2,000–$4,999 → 50% bonus tokens• $5,000+ → 100% bonus tokens There is also a referral program paying 10% on both sides, supercharging participation. To understand the upside, consider this math: a $5,000 contribution doubles to $10,000 in tokens instantly. Add in 166% APY during Stage 6, and the value grows to about $26,600. If BTC3 trades at $15 post-launch, the stack is worth over $25,000 before rewards. Even smaller tiers are powerful. A $3,000 entry becomes $4,500 with bonuses, compounding to nearly $12,000 with PoY, while $1,000 grows to over $3,000. Influencers driving momentum The buzz is not limited to numbers. Influencers and crypto reviewers are breaking down why Bitcoin Swift is exploding. Crypto Show has praised its technical architecture. Bull Run Angel has emphasized the strength of its PoY design and AI integration. Crypto Sister also highlighted BTC3’s potential to outpace traditional projects. Their coverage shows why Bitcoin Swift has jumped from underdog to front-runner on crypto watchlists worldwide. Meanwhile, channels like Token Galaxy are reinforcing the narrative that BTC3 is a breakout project. Final conclusion Ethereum’s ETF buzz may have fizzled, but Bitcoin Swift is stealing the spotlight with real payouts, transparent audits, and an early launch that has set the market on fire. With Stage 6 closing and Stage 7 just ahead, investors have less than 6 days to act before the presale ends. The combination of PoY, AI contracts, zk identity, Solana speed, and verified compliance makes BTC3 the most exciting crypto opportunity of 2025. The momentum charts prove it.

        "BODY": "Ripple is a giant in the crypto space, but August 2025 is seeing a distinct shift. More investors are adding altcoins like Pengu and Layer Brett to their portfolios, challenging the dominance of Ripple and other legacy names. With Ethereum Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett delivers near-instant transactions and gas fees that cost pennies, while Ethereum Layer 1 and even Ripple can see fees spike to several dollars in periods of congestion. Why Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge over Ripple This technical advantage positions Layer Brett as both a Memecoin and a utility powerhouse. While Dogecoin, Bonk, and Pepe have built strong communities, their underlying blockchains face congestion and high costs. Layer Brett’s Ethereum Layer 2 solution gives it a real edge, allowing for massive scalability and seamless staking. The XRP price and why altcoins like Pengu and Layer Brett are trending The XRP price recently hit $3.23, and the market cap for Ripple stands at an impressive $192.48 billion. However, investors are increasingly hunting for the next 100x altcoin, and Layer Brett, Pengu, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are capturing that attention. The current presale price for $LBRETT is just $0.0044, making it a low-cap crypto gem for those seeking massive upside during the 2025 crypto bull run. Pengu is also gaining traction, trading at $0.04 with a $2.27 billion market cap and solid DeFi integration. Yet, it is Layer Brett’s blend of meme energy and Layer 2 speed that is setting it apart from established competitors like Brett (original), Bonk, and Dogecoin. Main selling points of Layer Brett: Built on Ethereum Layer 2: Fast, scalable, and ultra-low gas fees 55,000% APY staking: Early buyers can stake via MetaMask or Trust Wallet Presale access: $LBRETT available now at $0.0044 with over $700,000 already contributed Community-first: Gamified staking, NFT rewards, and DAO governance on the roadmap What makes Layer Brett different from Brett, Shiba Inu, and Bonk Unlike Brett (original) or Shiba Inu, which have seen periods of high volatility and consolidation, Layer Brett is built for lasting utility. Bonk’s all-time high was $0.00005916, but recent months have brought a gradual decline and little innovation. Dogecoin, despite its $34.83 billion market cap, has seen no major upgrades or partnerships recently. Layer Brett, in contrast, offers a transparent tokenomics model: 10 billion meme tokens in total, with 30% for presale, 25% for staking, and significant allocations for ecosystem rewards and development. Its staking rewards, at a headline 55,000% APY, dwarf those of virtually every major competitor, including Pepe and Pengu. Why the crypto community is getting behind Layer Brett and Pengu The current crypto landscape is fueled by FOMO keywords like best crypto to buy now, trending cryptocurrencies, and next big crypto. Community power is driving Layer Brett, Pengu, and even Brett (original) into thousands of new portfolios. Meme coin enthusiasts are also drawn by Layer Brett’s $1 million community rewards allocation and plans for DAO governance. The buzz is real: Layer Brett’s presale success, low entry price, and Layer 2 technology are shifting attention away from established coins like Ripple, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin. Conclusion: The best crypto presale opportunity in 2025 Layer Brett is still in presale, but this window will not last. With a much smaller market cap than XRP price, Shiba Inu, or Pengu, but with Ethereum Layer 2 power and meme-driven momentum, it is perfectly positioned for explosive growth. Don’t miss your chance to join the next top meme coin and stake for potentially life-changing rewards.

        "BODY": "The crypto market has been buzzing after a staggering 7,567 BTC, worth nearly $756 million, was transferred to a single wallet. Large-scale moves like this often signal changes in liquidity distribution and fresh opportunities for growth across the market. As capital flows through new channels, decentralized finance is poised to benefit — and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 in its presale, is catching the spotlight as investors search for their next high-conviction play. Bitcoin (BTC) sees a wallet migration On August 16, 2025, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale transferred 7,567 BTC (~$756 million) from Coinbase to an unknown wallet. BTC trades at ~$113,500, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 billion. The migration, part of a broader trend of dormant wallet activity, sparked speculation of accumulation or custody transfer, with no immediate exchange deposits signaling a sale. Technical indicators show BTC testing $112,000 support, with RSI at 44 and resistance at $116,713. Despite $2.7 billion in weekly ETF inflows, macro pressures like U.S. tariffs and $800 million in liquidations add volatility. Social media reflects mixed sentiment, noting potential bullish accumulation. A break above $116,713 could target $121,500, but a drop below $112,000 risks $110,000. Why Bitcoin (BTC) flows strengthen the case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Large Bitcoin (BTC) transfers reflect shifts in how liquidity is being positioned, and history shows that capital rotation often funnels into promising DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been built precisely for this environment, offering a decentralized and non-custodial liquidity protocol designed to unlock new opportunities for lenders and borrowers alike. Lenders will be able to deposit blue-chip like ETH or BTC and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC into liquidity pools, earning interest while retaining full control of their assets. Borrowers will gain access to overcollateralized loans, allowing them to tap liquidity without being forced to sell their long-term engagement. Every deposit will generate mtTokens, ERC-20 tokens that represent the user’s position and grow in value as interest accrues. These mtTokens will not only allow lenders to track earnings but will also integrate seamlessly with other decentralized finance ecosystems, ensuring that liquidity remains active and versatile. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. This stablecoin will only be minted when collateral is deposited, and it will be burned upon repayment or liquidation. Governance will control interest rates, adjusting them to maintain the peg. For instance, if the stablecoin’s price rises above $1, borrowing rates will be lowered; if it falls, rates will be increased. Arbitrage opportunities will help reinforce the peg, while overcollateralization ensures safety. This innovation provides an additional utility that will strengthen the demand for MUTM within the ecosystem. Presale momentum, trust, and roadmap confidence With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already advanced to Phase 6 of its presale. Priced at $0.035, over $14.83 million has been raised with 25% of tokens sold and more than 15,650 holders joining the growing community. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will climb by 15% to $0.04, making this stage the final chance for investors to secure entry at the current discounted level before the next valuation reset. Trust and transparency remain a cornerstone of the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit, scoring 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet, alongside static analysis and manual review of smart contracts. To further ensure protocol safety, a $50,000 bug bounty program has been established, rewarding researchers for identifying vulnerabilities by severity. This security-first approach enhances long-term sustainability and strengthens investor confidence. The community is growing just as quickly as the presale. More than 12,000 Twitter followers are actively engaging with the project, while a $100,000 giveaway — with 10 winners each receiving $10,000 in MUTM — has added another layer of excitement. Strong holder growth and active social channels are ensuring that momentum continues to build heading into the listing. The roadmap ahead adds even more conviction. The beta version of the platform will launch alongside the live token event, allowing early users to immediately test and use the lending and borrowing mechanics. This early exposure will help attract demand at the same time exchange listings are expected on platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and MEXC. With these milestones ahead, the alignment between technology rollout and investor access is positioned to generate sustained traction. Conclusion As Bitcoin (BTC) whales move liquidity and the market recalibrates, projects that can capture new flows stand to benefit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few presale projects aligning product readiness, trust through audit, and strong community engagement at exactly the right time. Crypto prices are increasingly being influenced by utility-driven projects, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering both innovation and access at just $0.035 today. With growing interest in crypto ETF markets and wider adoption, investor rotation into presale opportunities like this has become a central strategy for crypto investing. As crypto predictions continue to emphasize the importance of real-world use cases, the path ahead for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is clear. For investors searching for a project ready to benefit from liquidity shifts sparked by Bitcoin (BTC)’s $756M migration, this presale stands out as the DeFi beneficiary set for a breakout.

        "BODY": "Japan-based Metaplanet has added more Bitcoin to its reserves this week, spending over $11 million to acquire 103 BTC. The company confirmed the move in a recent disclosure , stating the purchase was executed at an average price of $113,491 per coin. Total Holdings Near 19,000 BTC With this addition, Metaplanet’s Bitcoin stash now stands at 18,991 BTC, valued at nearly $2 billion based on current prices. The company’s average acquisition cost across all holdings is about $102,712 per coin. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, this makes Metaplanet the seventh-largest publicly listed BTC holder, sitting just behind Riot Platforms Inc. and Bullish, the crypto firm backed by Peter Thiel. The company’s timing has often aligned with key price swings. Reports show that during the first quarter of 2025, Metaplanet recorded a over 95% return on its Bitcoin strategy. The second quarter proved even stronger at 129%, while July through late August delivered a 29% gain. Overall, the investment has grown by close to 480%, far outpacing most traditional equity plays. Institutional Buys Keep Rolling Metaplanet’s move comes as Michael Saylor hinted at another purchase for his firm Strategy . Saylor posted on X that “Bitcoin is on Sale,” fueling speculation of more buying activity. That message followed Strategy’s recent acquisitions—430 BTC worth $51 million last week and 775 BTC just days earlier. The firm now controls 629,376 BTC, accounting for nearly 3% of BTC’s circulating supply. Such large-scale buying underscores how corporations are doubling down on Bitcoin , even at prices above $110,000. For Metaplanet, the decision also serves as a hedge. Japan’s weakening yen has raised concerns among investors, and crypto appears to offer a measure of protection against currency risk. Bitcoin Holds Steady Bitcoin remained mostly flat, trading around $112,000 after briefly dipping to $110,000 over the weekend. Analysts point out that this muted price response is common, as large purchases often occur over-the-counter, reducing short-term market impact. ERIC TRUMP: BITCOIN TO SURPASS $175K IN 2025 At Jackson Hole, Eric Trump predicted BTC will cross $175,000 this year, declaring himself a “Bitcoin Maxi.” — First Squawk (@FirstSquawk) August 24, 2025 In the meantime, sentiment in the wider crypto market remains bullish. US President Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, recently called himself a “Bitcoin Maxi” and forecasted that the asset could reach $175,000 within 2025. Along with ongoing institutional buying, these types of predictions drive anticipation of higher prices in the coming months. There have also been indications that Metaplanet could be on a weekly build-up approach, considering its latest buying activity. If the pattern continues, further crypto purchases could be in the offing. Featured image from eGamers.io, chart from TradingView",

        "BODY": "Solana is holding its dominance in decentralized finance with a striking performance in July. Reports indicate that DEX activity on its network hit $124 billion during the month, extending a winning streak against Ethereum to 10 straight months. Analysts say this gives Solana a 40% edge over its rival in this segment, signaling a clear shift in user behavior. Related Reading: Ether Soars In August—But Will September Spoil The Party? Shift To Solana Picks Up Speed Reports have disclosed a sharp rise in new projects choosing Solana. Alliance DAO data show that more than 40% of founders in the first half of 2025 picked Solana, up from 25% a year earlier. That change is being linked to Solana’s ability to run large numbers of transactions quickly and at low cost, which makes it attractive to teams building performance-focused DeFi apps. This week in data by @SolanaFloor: Solana outpaced Ethereum in DEX trading volume for the 10th consecutive month, reaching $124B in July, 42% higher than Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/TT0nb8wrtm — Solana (@solana) August 23, 2025 Developers say they want speed and predictable fees. Solana offers both. The move by creators is not trivial; it reshapes where new liquidity and smart-contract work gets built. Solana’s DEX volumes have not just grown; they have been sustained. For 10 straight months Solana has outpaced Ethereum on that metric. That streak is unusual. It shows trading activity and automated market makers on Solana are busy. Onlookers point out that higher DEX throughput can draw more users, and more users can bring more developers. A feedback loop can form. Technical Signals Based on reports, SOL is trading above the $205 zone after a recent breakout. The 20-day SMA sits near $191 and is being watched as short-term support. Market indicators are cited as positive. The MACD is showing green movement bars, which some traders interpret as upward momentum. $SOL is on a one-way ticket to the moon. 🚀 After a brutal drop, Solana has found its footing and is riding a perfect uptrend channel. The path to $300 is wide open pic.twitter.com/vR4HdL272O — 𝐊𝐚𝐦𝐫𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐬𝐠𝐡𝐚𝐫 (@Karman_1s) August 24, 2025 Analysts have set nearby resistance points at $215, $228, and $240. Kamran Asghar is among those forecasting a longer-term target of $300 if current trends persist. At the same time, Ethereum has been volatile: it fell below $4,800 and briefly swung from about $4,940 down to under $4,720 within hours, a move that underscored how choppy markets remain. This was echoed by crypto analyst Ali on X, suggesting his bearish opinion as the market changed in sentiment. IT’S SO OVER! $ETH pic.twitter.com/atcQbHhMJi — Ali (@ali_charts) August 24, 2025 Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss Solana’s gains are happening while Ethereum handles continued institutional demand and holds leadership in other measures. That contrast suggests the market is fragmenting in where different types of activity concentrate — DEX volume on one chain, institutional flows on another. The shift of new projects toward Solana is being framed as a practical response to throughput limits rather than as a wholesale rejection of Ethereum.

        "BODY": "Eric Trump didn’t wake up one day and decide crypto was cool. He said his family was forced into it after banks shut them out without warning. Speaking to The Wall Street Journal , Eric repeated that several financial institutions dumped the Trump Organization in early 2021, right after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. They shut down hundreds of accounts. Eric called the collective decision political and said it exposed how weak and “weaponized” the banking system had become. “At that time, I realized how fragile the financial system was and how easily it could be weaponized against you,” he said. With no time to spare, the Trump family started moving millions of dollars across smaller banks. Eric said they eventually found a new bank to work with, but he didn’t name it. The idea of “debanking” has since become a rallying cry for conservatives and crypto circles. Republicans claim banks now discriminate based on political beliefs. Eric, who now leads much of the Trump Organization’s activity, said it was that exact experience that opened the door for their entry into crypto. Eric leads Trump family crypto deals across bitcoin, stablecoins, and tokens Eric didn’t hesitate. He took the lead. He helped move the Trump empire into crypto markets fast; Bitcoin mining, token investments, and new blockchain ventures. Their most valuable stake is in World Liberty Financial, which was recently valued at $4.5 billion. The firm introduced WLFI, a token, and also created a dollar-linked stablecoin. Eric insisted this had nothing to do with government work. “I literally have nothing to do with Washington, D.C.,” he said , pushing back against claims of conflict of interest. But critics say the lines are blurred. Democrats and outside watchdogs accuse the family of exploiting the presidency to benefit financially. President Trump recently signed an executive order directing regulators to examine if banks denied services based on political or religious views. The order also calls for punishment if discrimination is found. At the same time, the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit against Capital One, one of the banks that ended its relationship with them. The bank denied any political motives. Executives in the sector say they’re often pushed to drop clients that could hurt their reputation. Eric’s closest friends were deep into crypto already. He said it offered protection that real estate couldn’t. Eric’s crypto dealings don’t stop there. ALT5 Sigma , a public crypto firm, bought $1.5 billion in WLFI tokens and added Eric to its board of directors. He also co-founded a mining startup called American Bitcoin, formed through a deal with Hut 8, a crypto mining company. Eric owns 9.3% of that company. Eric defends $TRUMP meme coin, pushes future tokenization of Trump Tower Ethics lawyers say this all reeks of self-dealing. Norm Eisen, the former White House ethics chief under Obama, said, “What Donald Trump is doing with crypto is the essence of corruption.” He pointed to Donald’s influence over the agencies that set crypto rules, while his family profits from crypto holdings. The White House dismissed those claims. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the allegations irresponsible and insisted, “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” Eric’s biggest public splash came with $TRUMP , a memecoin that launched three days before Donald returned to the White House. At one point, the token had a $15 billion market cap. It now sits closer to $1.7 billion. Nobody outside the Trump circle knows how the profits are divided. Eric said memecoins like $TRUMP serve as entry points. “If somebody wants to go in and they want to buy $TRUMP, congratulations, now you have access to Bitcoin, you have access to Ethereum, you have access to USD1, you have access to the United States dollar,” he said. “You just took the first step in actually creating some financial freedom that I think so many people around the world want.” Eric also teased tokenizing the Trump Tower. He asked why it shouldn’t be possible to sell pieces of it to global investors via blockchain. “They love New York. They love Fifth Avenue. They love Trump,” he said.

        "BODY": "SBI Group, a leading Japanese financial conglomerate, has joined forces with Chainlink, a prominent blockchain oracle platform, to advance the adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and stablecoins. The partnership comes as Chainlink gains momentum amid global interest in tokenized real-world assets and adoption of stablecoins. LINK, the native Chainlink token that has gained by over 110% in the past year, was just in the green as traders digested the latest news. aims to reshape the landscape of global digital finance, starting with Japan’s robust market. Chainlink and SBI announce strategic partnership In an announcement published on Monday, team Chainlink said it has struck a strategic alliance with SBI Group, a Japanese financial behemoth with over $200 billion in assets. The two industry giants plan to tap into their infrastructure and expertise to drive fresh adoption of tokenised real-world assets across the globe. First stop – Japan. The partnership will focus on pioneering use cases such as tokenising real estate, bonds, and other tangible assets, alongside the development of regulated stablecoins. Key technologies driving this initiative include Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which ensures secure cross-chain transactions, and SmartData, which provides real-time net asset value (NAV) data for enhanced transparency. Additionally, Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve will verify the reserves backing stablecoins, ensuring compliance and trust. Yoshitaka Kitao, chairman and CEO of SBI Holdings, lauded the partnership as a major move. He also emphasised the synergy between the two companies, noting that Chainlink’s reliability complements SBI’s financial reach. Together, the move has the potential to unlock further use for the crypto platform’s secure, compliant solutions. It could transform cross-border transactions and digital asset adoption in Japan, the region and globally. While teaming up is a big deal for TradFi and crypto, it’s not the first collaboration between Chainlink and SBI. The market already witnessed a successful prior collaboration under Singapore’s Project Guardian. In this effort, Chainlink, SBI Digital Markets, and UBS Asset Management joined forces for an initiative on automated fund administration using smart contracts. What does it mean for Chainlink? Not many crypto platforms can boast the kind of traction Chainlink is seeing today. And this partnership marks yet another pivotal milestone in this regard for Chainlink. In addition to expanding the oracle network’s solution to more users, it solidifies its position as one of the leading platforms for blockchain interoperability and data integrity. Notably, aligning with SBI Group allows Chainlink access to one of Japan’s most influential financial ecosystems. Potentially, the next step is the unlocking of vast opportunities in a market valued at trillions of dollars. “SBI’s choice to rely on the Chainlink standard for their digital asset transactions shows that the security/reliability, compliance features, and cross-border connectivity of Chainlink are what is needed to do high-value institutional transactions,” said Sergey Nazarov, co-founder, Chainlink. A deeper integration and growth amid the alliance could boost the adoption of Chainlink’s token LINK. Mainly, enterprise adoption will generate revenue that will feed into Chainlink’s reserve model. LINK, which has outpaced peers in the past few weeks, could gain further. Chainlink’s CCIP, Data Streams and other solutions that drive liquidity and operational efficiency, are likely to be a big part of the growth.

        "BODY": "BitcoinWorld Binance New Listings: Exciting A2Z, SSV, UMA Spot Pairs Arrive August 26 The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Binance, the leading global crypto exchange, prepares to expand its offerings. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting the latest Binance new listings , set to go live on August 26. This significant update brings fresh opportunities for portfolio diversification and strategic trading, directly impacting how users engage with the dynamic digital asset market. What Are These Exciting Binance New Listings? Binance officially announced on its website that it will introduce three new spot trading pairs. These additions include A2Z/USDC, SSV/USDC, and UMA/USDC. These new pairs will become available for trading at 08:00 UTC on August 26 . This expansion is a clear indicator of Binance’s commitment to providing a wide array of trading options to its vast user base. Let’s take a quick look at what these new assets generally represent: A2Z: While specific details on “A2Z” are less common in the broad crypto space without more context, new listings often represent innovative projects or emerging tokens that meet Binance’s rigorous listing criteria. SSV (SSV Network): SSV Network is a decentralized staking infrastructure, allowing for distributed control over Ethereum validators. It aims to enhance the security, decentralization, and fault tolerance of Ethereum staking. UMA (Universal Market Access): UMA is a synthetic asset protocol that allows users to create self-enforcing financial contracts. It enables the creation of various synthetic tokens, representing real-world assets or derivatives on the blockchain. The inclusion of USDC as the base pair is also noteworthy. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, offering traders a reliable and less volatile option for entering and exiting positions, especially during periods of market fluctuations. This provides a stable anchor for exploring these new opportunities. Why Do Binance New Listings Offer Tremendous Opportunities? The introduction of these Binance new listings brings several compelling benefits for traders and the broader crypto ecosystem. Firstly, they enhance market liquidity by providing more avenues for capital flow. Secondly, they offer users the chance to diversify their portfolios beyond established cryptocurrencies, potentially tapping into emerging trends and technologies. Moreover, these new pairs can: Create new trading strategies: Traders can leverage the new pairs for arbitrage, swing trading, or long-term investment strategies. Increase market visibility: Listing on Binance significantly boosts the profile of A2Z, SSV, and UMA, bringing them to a global audience. Foster innovation: By listing projects like SSV and UMA, Binance supports protocols that contribute to the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain infrastructure. For active traders, the initial hours and days following a new listing often present heightened volatility and trading volume, which can lead to significant opportunities for those who are well-prepared and understand the market dynamics. Preparing for Binance New Listings: Smart Strategies To make the most of these upcoming Binance new listings , it is crucial for traders to approach them with a well-thought-out strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research: Before trading A2Z, SSV, or UMA, understand their underlying technology, use cases, team, and market cap. Knowledge is power in the fast-paced crypto world. Start Small: Especially with new listings, prices can be highly volatile. Consider starting with smaller position sizes to mitigate risk. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital by implementing stop-loss orders to automatically exit a trade if the price moves against your prediction. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on social media, news, and community discussions surrounding these tokens. Sentiment can heavily influence short-term price movements. Understand USDC: Since all these pairs are against USDC, familiarity with stablecoin trading mechanics is beneficial. Remember, while new listings can offer exciting prospects, they also come with inherent risks due to their novelty and potentially lower liquidity compared to more established assets. Always prioritize risk management and trade responsibly. The upcoming Binance new listings of A2Z/USDC, SSV/USDC, and UMA/USDC on August 26 represent a fantastic expansion of trading possibilities for the crypto community. By staying informed, conducting diligent research, and employing smart trading strategies, users can confidently navigate these new opportunities. Binance continues to solidify its position as a leading platform by consistently introducing diverse and innovative assets, empowering traders to explore the vast potential of the digital economy.

A2: Spot trading involves the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. A spot trading pair, like A2Z/USDC, means you are trading A2Z directly against USDC.

        "BODY": "2025 is shaping up as a year of contrasts in digital assets. Some crypto coins are stuck in flat trading ranges, others are swinging wildly on crypto charts, leaving investors unsure about where to allocate capital. Against this uneven backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already turning heads. Still in presale, its token has surged from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.035 in Phase 6, delivering a 250% rise even before exchange listing. And with more phases ahead, investors are starting to recognize that MUTM is not just another project—it is building a decentralized finance platform that is expected to unlock consistent value. How P2C and P2P lending will fuel demand What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand apart is its dual lending design. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, investors will deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools, earning interest while giving borrowers access to flexible liquidity. For example, a user who deposits $10,000 worth of ETH at a 65% loan-to-value ratio will be positioned to earn a 15% APY. That works out to $1,500 in passive yield annually, all while the collateralized ETH continues to participate in price growth. On the borrower’s side, pledging BTC as collateral will unlock up to 75% of its value without selling, ensuring they maintain upside exposure while gaining liquidity for new opportunities. The peer-to-peer (P2P) lending angle adds another dimension. Here, riskier tokens such as FLOKI or SHIB will be isolated in independent markets where lenders and borrowers will directly negotiate rates. This separation protects MUTM’s main liquidity pools while giving adventurous investors the chance to seek higher yields. By allowing both structured stability and high-risk flexibility, the platform is expected to attract diverse participants—ranging from conservative ETH holders to high-risk meme token traders. Presale momentum and why FOMO is growing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already demonstrating traction. In Phase 6, the token is priced at $0.035 with over $14.83 million raised, 25% of tokens sold, and more than 15,650 holders engaged. The project has also undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, highlighting its focus on security. To further boost early engagement, MUTM has launched a $100,000 giveaway for ten winners and a $50,000 bug bounty program with severity-based rewards. Community presence is also growing, with more than 12,000 followers across social platforms showing interest in the project’s vision. Investors are already seeing the kind of returns that make others ask: Is crypto a good investment right now if you know where to look? Those who swapped $5,000 worth of SOL back in Phase 1, when the token was priced at $0.01, would now hold $17,500 in MUTM at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. That is a remarkable return for a project still in presale. The presale momentum is more than just hype. Future demand for the token will be driven by core utilities such as lending, borrowing, and staking mtTokens, which are expected to generate consistent buy pressure. Add to this the buy-and-distribute mechanism, where revenue from platform activity will be used to repurchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to stakers, and it becomes clear why the project is forecasted to sustain long-term demand. At the same time, projections point to further exposure once the beta launch goes live, and expected listings on top exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase are expected to expand accessibility worldwide. With the listing price already set at $0.06, investors entering at $0.035 in Phase 6 are positioned for strong near-term ROI once the token goes live. Compared to passively holding assets like SOL through market volatility, investing in crypto via a growing DeFi ecosystem like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to deliver far more compelling upside. Conclusion The roadmap is equally ambitious. The upcoming beta release will allow early users to experience the lending and borrowing mechanics first-hand, while institutional partnerships and multi-chain expansion will further fuel adoption. As participation grows, demand for MUTM will intensify—driving both platform utility and token value higher. Phase 7 is already approaching, which will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase from today’s entry point. Missing out on Phase 6 will mean missing one of the steepest discounts before MUTM reaches its exchange price of $0.06. For those serious about investing in crypto and searching for the best entry in 2025, the window for maximum leverage on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is right now.

While the upward trend in BTC weakened, Ethereum (ETH) reached a new ATH over the weekend, and it is stated that giant whales are behind this rise in ETH. At this point, analysts said that Bitcoin OG whales are selling BTC and buying ETH, which is shifting capital to Ethereum and creating volatility in the market. WhaleWire CEO Jacob King said Bitcoin's price crashed due to whale selling. According to Jacob King, the drop Bitcoin (BTC) experienced earlier today was triggered by a single whale selling over 24,000 BTC to buy Ethereum (ETH). The analyst stated in his post that he sold more than 24,000 BTC, including BTC that he had not moved for more than five years, and sent more than 12,000 BTC to the Hyperunite platform today alone. The analyst noted that this was part of a broader sell-off that has already seen 18,000 BTC ($2 billion) sold, with most of the money moving into Ethereum. According to the analyst, $2 billion was bought and $1.3 billion was staked. According to Lookonchain's post, the Bitcoin OG whale, who bought 100,784 BTC (worth $642 million at the time, now $11.4 billion) 7 years ago, is frantically swapping his BTCs for Ethereum. Accordingly, over the last five days, the giant whale deposited 22,769 BTC ($2.59 billion) into Hyperliquid for sale. With this money, he purchased 472,920 ETH ($2.22 billion) from the spot market and opened a 135,265 ETH ($577 million) long position. No Single Whale Can Be Responsible for Bitcoin's Decline! However, speaking to The Block, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said that it is difficult to pinpoint a single culprit for the Bitcoin price drop. “Bitcoin's rise after Powell's speech was driven by a lack of liquidity, not by any lasting belief. Once the leverage was unwound, momentum quickly faded and BTC fell below key levels again. “Furthermore, the drop is more likely to be the work of multiple whales or an exchange with a significant stake, rather than a single individual. Large-scale transactions like the recent drop typically require institutional investors or coordinated action.” Liu also highlighted the growing interest in Ethereum, saying, “With Ethereum ETF staking approval on the horizon, expect ETH performance to further improve with increased staking activity and a potential altcoin season. Ethereum is expected to take center stage.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Roles Have Reversed! Whales Are Frantically Selling BTC and Buying ETH!

        "BODY": "The governance organization running the Stargate cross-chain bridge has approved LayerZero’s acquisition offer. The decisive voting, which ended yesterday, saw 7.2 million participants (94.76%) supporting the deal and 399.4K (5.24%) against. Source – stgdao The development raised eyebrows among the cryptocurrency community as it signalled a key momentum in the rivalry among interoperability networks. Meanwhile, LayerZero’s acquisition deal marks the end of Stargate DAO, with STG holders swapping their holdings for native token ZRO at 1 STG to 0.08634 ZRO. The LayerZero team commented, stating: LayerZero sits at the intersection of two unstoppable trends: the inevitable tokenization of all assets and the proliferation of blockchains. Acquiring Starget (STG) perfectly positions us to power the next leg of blockchain adoption: The Cryptoization of Finance. LayerZero succeeds after pushback The approval wasn’t a walk in the park. Initially, STG holders criticised the offer as it meant losing yield returns. Many had locked the STG tokens to get veSTG, which allows access to Starget’s fee revenues. Also, LayerZero’s competitor, Wormhole, announced a ‘better’ offer , urging the Starget community to delay their decision and consider alternative bids. The Axelar Foundation and Hart Lambur of Across confirmed they will submit formal bids if Starget DAO pauses the voting for five days. The bold interest signals the rising competition within the blockchain interoperability industry. The Wormhole Foundation believes LayerZero undervalues Starget’s potential, especially as interoperability protocols gain traction. Meanwhile, LayerZero adjusted its offer in response to these pushbacks. Rather than suspending income for veSTG enthusiasts, it will allocate half of Starget’s revenue to veSTG holders for 6 months after the voting. The remaining 50% and excess profits will move to ZRO’s buy-and-burn initiative to enrich LayerZero’s ecosystem in the long run. Despite the hiccups, the voting concluded on Saturday night, with members supporting LayerZero’s offer. The LayerZero Foundation celebrated the approval, with plans to scale Starget into a complete financial powerhouse. They said: Starget has been home to millions of users and is the central liquidity hub across chains. So far, it’s focused on bridging, token expansion, and stablecoins. With LayerZero, it will rapidly ship a full suite of financial infrastructure, including swaps, vaults, and more. What’s next for STG investors As the official acquisition translates to dissolving Starget DAO, STG holders will migrate into LayerZero, swapping their coins for ZRO. LayerZero @LayerZero_Core · Follow The Stargate DAO has approved our acquisition of Stargate (STG).We’ve spent four years building the rails to reinvent how value moves. Today, we accelerate our network effects.LayerZero is better money technology.Stargate is the interface for value transfer. 5:53 am · 24 Aug 2025 1.0K Reply Copy link Read 115 replies veSGT holders will enjoy revenue-sharing perks for six months after the voting. After that, LayerZero will no longer distribute fee revenue to holders. It will shift the profits to supporting ZRO through token burns and buyback programs. STG and ZRO price outlook The native token recorded minor upticks amidst the developments. While bears limit uptrends, STG gained 1% in the past day to $0.1795. Also, ZRO soared 0.8% on its daily timeframe to $2.08. Source – CoinMarketCap The duo has seen its 24-hour trading volume increase by over 300%. That potentially confirms increased actions from participants seeking volatility opportunities. The post Starget DAO approves LayerZero’s STG acquisition deal appeared first on Invezz",

        "BODY": "A significant cryptocurrency whale is making a colossal bet on Ethereum’s future. This Bitcoin OG, holding an enormous 14,837 BTC, has just sold 670.1 BTC. Consequently, this move has generated approximately $76 million in capital. Moreover, the entity has instantly redeployed these funds into a massive long position on Ethereum. This strategic rotation involves opening leveraged longs totaling 68,130 ETH. These longs valued at a staggering $295 million are capturing widespread attention across crypto markets. Simultaneously, sophisticated investors are concentrating their efforts on a promising new DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This altcoin is currently experiencing remarkable demand during its ongoing presale event. Bitcoin whale rotates into Ethereum A monumental transaction is currently unfolding on the Hyperliquid exchange. A veteran Bitcoin investor is executing a profound portfolio reallocation. The whale has sold a portion of its legendary Bitcoin holdings, which are worth $76 million. Following this sale, the investor has opened a colossal long position on Ethereum. This action is spread across four separate wallets for this new exposure. Such a decisive move often indicates a strong belief in an asset’s imminent price appreciation. Consequently, this activity is generating significant discussion about Ethereum’s potential short-term upside. Furthermore, it highlights a growing trend of diversification among Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. Smart money favours Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While this whale focuses on Ethereum, other intelligent investors are targeting a different opportunity. They have been accumulating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens during its presale. This is not another altcoin; it is a fundamental utility in decentralized finance. The protocol is building a groundbreaking peer-to-peer lending platform. As a result, its native token, MUTM, is a key to its services and rewards. The presale has already collected a significant amount of money, 14,750,000, with 15,550 holders. This massive support shows a high level of trust in the vision of the project and its practical implementation. Mutuum Finance presale momentum The Mutuum Finance presale is currently in its sixth phase, and it is progressing rapidly. Investors are eagerly acquiring MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.035. This price point represents a massive 250% increase from the initial offering price of $0.01 in the first phase. The chance to purchase tokens at this level is quickly disappearing as the phase sells out. Immediately afterwards, phase seven will commence, implementing a 14.3% price increase to $0.04 per token. This continual appreciation offers current buyers a potential 400% return on investment when MUTM launches at its listing price of $0.06. Unrivalled utility and security Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through genuine utility and ironclad security. The project has successfully finalized its CertiK audit. MUTM achieved an exceptional 95.00 security score. This result confirms a robust and secure smart contract foundation with no discovered vulnerabilities. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. A reward pool of $50,000 USDT is available for identifying any security issues, split into tiers based on severity. Beyond security, the team has launched a dashboard featuring a leaderboard. The top 50 holders will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions, incentivizing long-term investment. Furthermore, the project is also hosting an enormous giveaway to celebrate its presale success. We are awarding a total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners; each recipient will receive $10,000. A clear path forward The crypto market is constantly evolving, with whales making calculated moves on established assets like Ethereum. However, the true opportunity for exponential growth often lies in early-stage projects with solid fundamentals. Mutuum Finance presents a compelling case with its innovative lending platform, successful audit, and rapidly selling presale. With its launch price set at $0.06, now is the optimal time to consider this best crypto to buy before the next price hike. Examine the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your position in this groundbreaking DeFi project.

        "BODY": "The cryptocurrency market has been volatile over the weekend, and the volatility could continue amid strong on-chain activities. BTC rallied to the $117k mark on Friday after Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole hinted at the possibility of an interest rate cut in September. However, the market has turned bearish since, with Bitcoin now trading around $112k. With a strong bearish trend, BTC could slip below $110k over the next few hours or days. BTC dips to $112k as whales migrate to Ethereum Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost more than 2% in the last 24 hours and now trades at $112,241. The bearish performance comes after BTC topped the $117k mark on Friday. The leading cryptocurrency experienced a flash dump late on Sunday, briefly dropping to the $111k mark. It bounced back to $114k but failed to build on this momentum and has now dropped below $113k. The negative performance came as analysts suggested that large holders were shifting their positions from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, pointed out that BTC’s dip is a “market recalibration” after rallying since the start of the year. Data revealed that a single whale sold over 24,000 BTC over the past several days, with some analysts attributing the market’s dump to this activity. WhaleWire CEO Jacob King revealed that the wallet address “19D5J…WoZ1C” moved multiple bulk amounts of BTC ranging from 3,000 BTC to 6,000 BTC to different addresses across Aug. 16 to 24. Jacob King @JacobKinge · Follow JUST IN: #Bitcoin flash crash today, which wiped out $310M in long positions, has been traced to a SINGLE Bitcoin whale dumping BTC for ETH.The whale sold 24,000+ BTC, including coins that hadn’t moved in 5+ years, sending 12,000+ #BTC today alone to the Hyperunite trading 2:39 am · 25 Aug 2025 1.6K Reply Copy link Read 190 replies King added that most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, with $2 billion worth of Ether bought by the whale, while another $1.3 billion was staked. The bearish performance also comes despite the Japanese bitcoin treasury firm, Metaplanet, disclosing on Monday that it bought an additional 103 BTC for $11.7 million. The firm has now spent $1.95 billion acquiring its overall bitcoin holdings (18,991 BTC) at an average price of $102,712 per bitcoin. Furthermore, the Philippines Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte proposed that the country’s central bank purchase an average of 2,000 BTC annually for five years, with a 20-year lockup period. The bill also proposes that the apex bank must not sell or trade the bitcoins for any purposes except to retire government debt. BTC could drop below $110k as selling pressure continues The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish following Bitcoin’s volatile movement over the weekend. The technical indicators remain bearish as the sell-off continues to affect the Bitcoin market. The RSI of 47 shows that BTC is currently heading into the oversold region if the bearish trend continues. The MACD lines have also crossed over into the negative territory, suggesting that sellers are currently in control. If the bearish trend continues, BTC could drop below Sunday’s swing low of $110,560. An extended bearish performance could see Bitcoin drop to the $107k support level for the first time since July 7. However, the market could bounce back soon, and BTC could reclaim the $114k resistance level in the coming hours or days. In the event of an extended bullish run, BTC could target the TLQ level at $117,100. The post BTC could dip below $110K amid whale migration: check forecast appeared first on Invezz",
